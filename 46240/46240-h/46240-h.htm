<h4 class="ActI" id="Act_One"><a class="no_dec" href="#Act_One_toc">ACT I</a></h4>

<p class="scene"><i>SCENE: Sitting-room at </i>55<i> Acacia Avenue. The principal articles
of furniture are the centre table, set for dinner for three, and a sideboard on the right.
There are folding doors at the back, leading to the front room, partly hidden by curtains;
on the left a low French window leading into the garden. On the right is a fire burning;
and above it a door into the kitchen.</i></p>

<p class="scene italics">The furniture of the room is a little mixed in style. A wicker
armchair is on one side of the fireplace, a folding carpet-chair on the other. The other
chairs, three at the table and two against the walls, are of bent wood. The sideboard is
mahogany. The carpet-square over oilcloth is of an indeterminate pattern in subdued
colours, dull crimson predominating. Lace curtains at window. Family photographs, a
wedding group and a cricket group, and a big lithograph copy of a Marcus Stone picture,
are on the walls. There is a brass alarm clock on the mantelpiece and one or two
ornaments. A sewing-machine stands on a small table near the window; and on the edge of
this table and on the small table on the other side of the window are pots of cuttings. A
couple of bookshelves hang over the machine. A small vase of flowers stands in the centre
of the dinner table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="scene italics"><span class="name">LILY WILSON,</span> much worried, is laying
the centre table. She is a pretty, slight woman, obviously young, wearing a light cotton
blouse, dark skirt and big pinafore. The front door is heard to close. <span
class="name">CHARLEY WILSON</span> enters. He is an ordinary specimen of the city clerk,
dressed in correct frock-coat, dark trousers, carefully creased, much cuff and a high
collar.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Here you are, then. [<i>She puts up her face and they
kiss hurriedly.</i>] Did I hear Mr. Tennant with you?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Met on the step.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> <i>How</i> funny! Well, that’s nice. We can have dinner
almost directly.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>putting down his hat carefully on sideboard, and
stretching himself slowly, with evident enjoyment.</i>] Saturday, thank the Lord!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>laughing prettily.</i>] Poor thing!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>looking at his silk hat.</i>] I should like to
pitch the beastly thing into the river. [<i>He shakes his fist at it. Then he stretches
his neck as if to lift it out of the collar and shaking down his cuffs till he can get a
fine view of them, regards them meditatively.</i>] Pah!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>anxiously.</i>] What’s the matter with them? Are
they scorched?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Scorched! No, they’re white enough. Beastly
uniform!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But you must wear cuffs, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> A chap came to the office to-day in a red tie. Old
Raffles had him up, and pitched into him. Asked him if he was a Socialist. Chap said he
wasn’t, but liked red. “So do I,” says the Boss, “but I don’t wear a golf coat in the
city!” Thought he was awfully smart, and it did make Poppy swear.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Who’s Poppy, dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Popperwell. He almost left there and then. Said he
should wear whatever tie he liked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It would have been rather silly of him, wouldn’t it?
He’s so sure there.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> That’s what <i>he</i> said. He thought better of it and
swallowed it. Well—dinner ready?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Waiting.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>going out.</i>] I’ll be down in a jiffy.</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">LILY</span> goes to the fire. <span
class="name">TENNANT</span> heard outside whistling a bar of the song “Off to
Philadelphia.” He comes in. He is a broad-shouldered young fellow, a little shy in his
manner with women.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Nice day, Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I’ve brought you home the paper, if you’d like it.
It’s the “Daily Mirror.”</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, thank you. I do like the pictures. Charley is
getting so dreadfully serious now in his reading, and won’t buy it. He takes the “Daily
Telegraph.” He thinks the gardening notes are so good.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> He’s luxurious. It’s a penny.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, he shares it with somebody. [<i>Pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> How goes the garden?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s rather trying—I should like to give up those peas
and things, and have chickens. They would be so useful.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY</span> goes out. <span
class="name">TENNANT</span> takes a map out of his pocket and stands studying it. <span
class="name">CHARLEY</span> and <span class="name">LILY</span> enter together. <span
class="name">CHARLEY</span> has made a wonderful change into a loose, rather creased suit
of bright brown, flannel shirt with soft collar, flowing tie and old slippers. A pipe is
sticking out of one pocket, and a newspaper out of the other. They sit down, and <span
class="name">LILY</span> tries not to look worried as <span class="name">CHARLEY</span>
laboriously cuts the small joint which she has brought in with her and put before him. He
splashes the gravy a little and has to use the sharpener. <span class="name">LILY</span>
serves vegetables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> I think I shall get one of Robertson’s pups.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It would be lovely.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> He’s got one he’ll let me have cheap.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I saw them last night. They’re a good breed. Make
fine house-dogs.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> That’s what you want round here. A quiet neighbourhood
like this is A&nbsp;1 for burglars.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You don’t think we shall have any, do you?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> No. 24 had ’em the other night.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> What were they after?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> 24? That’s the new people. What a shame!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Wanted the wedding presents.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> And Mrs. Thompson told me they had real silver at
24.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Trust the burglars for knowing that. They won’t risk
their skins for electro. So <i>we</i> shan’t have ’em.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley! You forget the biscuit barrel and the
tray.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Where’s the Bobby?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> There’s only one about here.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> They don’t have Bobbies for burgles in these sort of
places, only for rows. And we don’t have rows. We’re too respectable.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I think it’s so mean of burglars to come to people like
us.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>with a burst of laughter.</i>] Let ’em go to
Portman Square, you say?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Well, of course, it’s wrong to steal at all; but it
doesn’t seem quite so bad. [<i>She stops, a little confused.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Of course it isn’t.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>lying back comfortably in his chair.</i>] Going
away Sunday?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No—the fact is—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Maggie is coming round this afternoon. Shall we ask the
Leslies for whist to-night?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> All right. Don’t make it too early, though. [<i>Looking
out of the French windows into the garden.</i>] I’ve got to get in my peas.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Green peas?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Green peas in that patch? My dear chap, don’t I wish I
could!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>to <span class="name">TENNANT.</span></i>] Have
some more?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No, thanks.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> For one thing, there’s the soil! It’s rotten. Then
there’re the sparrows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Some of them are so tame, dear, and they don’t seem to
care a bit for the cat next door.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>bitterly.</i>] They don’t care for anything. I wish
they’d take a fancy to a few snails.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> They don’t eat snails.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> You spoil ’em. She gives ’em soaked bread all through
the winter, and then expects me to grow things. Lord!</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY</span> collects plates. <span
class="name">TENNANT</span> goes out. <span class="name">CHARLEY</span> lights pipe. <span
class="name">CHARLEY</span> goes to window, where he stands leaning against the post and
smoking.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> The baby across the road is such a darling,
Charley.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> The girl was out with it this morning, and I called her
over.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s a boy.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY’S</span> replies are without
interest and he continues to gaze out into garden.</p>

<p class="noindent">They’re going to call him Theodore Clement Freeman. It’s rather a lot,
isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> What’s he got it all for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> After her father and his father and Freeman is a family
name.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> What did they want to give ’em all to <i>him</i> for?
They should keep some for the next.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> It’s silly. Still, it’s their business.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It might be a girl.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Well—there’s the others.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> My dear girl, why not?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I don’t like you to speak like that.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> I— [<i>Stops suddenly, looks at her, and comes over. He
takes her face between his hands.</i>] You silly! [<i>Kisses her.</i>]</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY</span> goes out with a tray of things
singing. <span class="name">CHARLEY</span> rolls up his sleeves and goes into the
garden.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">TENNANT</span> comes in and looks round.
<span class="name">CHARLEY</span> comes to the window with a spade.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> You—er—busy?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>lighting his pipe.</i>] Um! Want a job? There’s a
nice little lot of squirming devils under that flower-pot that want killing. Take your
time over it.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Thanks. My fancy doesn’t lie in gardening.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Filthy soil, this.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Mrs. Wilson would like to keep chickens.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Not if I know it! I’d rather go into a flat.
[<i>Leaning against the door and smoking thoughtfully.</i>] I could chuck the lot
sometimes. These two-penny-halfpenny back yards make me sick.</p>

<p class="italics direction">Pause.</p>

<p class="noindent">I’d give something for a piece of good land. Something to pay you for
your labour. [<i>Rousing.</i>] Well—going out?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>uneasily.</i>] Yes—presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>turning to look at him.</i>] What’s up?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I’ve—er—got some news for you.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Anything wrong?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No—no! The fact is—I’m going to hook it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>astonished.</i>] Hook it? Where to?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I’m sick of the whole show. I can’t stand it any
longer.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>trying to realise the situation.</i>] Do you mean
you’ve left Molesey’s?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Yes. I’m going to leave England—and so, you see,
I’ve got to leave here—your place.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Leave England? Got a crib?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> What are you going for then?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Because I’m sick of it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> So am I, and so are others. Do you mean you are just
going out because you want a change?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> That’s about it. I’ve had enough of grind.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Well, perhaps you’ll get grind somewhere else.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> It’ll be a change of grind then. That’s
something.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Canada?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No, Australia.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Phew! That’s a long shot. Got any friends there?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> It’s a bit risky, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Of course it’s risky. But who wouldn’t have a little
risk instead of that beastly hole every day for years? Scratch, scratch, scratch, and
nothing in the end, mind you?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>ironically.</i>] You might become a junior
partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>ignoring the remark.</i>] Suppose I stay there.
They’ll raise the screw every year till I get what they think is enough for me. Then you
just stick. I suppose I should marry and have a little house somewhere, and grind on.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>looking round.</i>] Like me.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY</span> heard singing off R.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No offence, old chap. It’s all right for some. It
suits you. You’re used to it. I want to see things a bit before I settle.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> is silent. His pipe has
gone out and he is staring at the floor.</p>

<p class="noindent">So I thought I’d go the whole plunge. I’ve got a little cash, of

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> makes no remark. <span

<p class="noindent">I’m—I feel a bit of a beast—but the fact is—I—it was decided in a

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> looks up.</p>

<p class="noindent">I’m going on Monday.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> On Monday! Why, that’s the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Yes, I know. It was like this. I heard of a man
who’s going Monday—a man I know—and it came over me all at once, why shouldn’t I go too? I
went to see him Friday—kept it dark here till I’d seen the guv’nor, and now it’s all
fixed. I’m awfully sorry to have played you like this—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Oh, rot! That’s nothing. But I say, it’s the rummest go
I ever heard of. What did Molesey say?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Slapped me on the back! What d’ye think of that? I
thought he’d call me a fool. He pointed out that I could stay there for ever, if I
liked—which was jolly decent of him—but when I said I’d rather not, thanks muchly, he
banged me on the back,<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[Pg

stop the money for notice.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Did he give you a £5 note?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>laughing.</i>] You don’t want much. The old chap

<p class="italics direction">Pause.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<i>Rising.</i>] The thing is—I can’t see why I didn’t go before. Why

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I suppose you’d call it good.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It was so sure. You’d have been head clerk in time. I’m

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Of course you must get tired of it sometimes. But to
throw it up altogether! I do hope you won’t be sorry for it. Charley gets tired of it

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>from the garden door.</i>] Just a bit—now and

Lil?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I don’t think you quite understand. It isn’t so much

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>sympathetically.</i>] It <i>is</i> trying to do the

Well, it’s the truth, anyway. At least, it’s not quite true. When I came here to-day I was
awfully happy about it—I am fond of him at least—I—well—he’s very nice—you know.
[<i>Irritably.</i>] What did you want to start this for, Lil?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>aggrieved.</i>] <i>I</i> start it? I did

the house properly, but I couldn’t be even a mother’s help unless I could wash.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I don’t know what you mean, Maggie. You haven’t got to
wash. You know Mr. Foster can afford to send it all out. [<i>Sighing enviously.</i>] That

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I heard of a girl the other day, Fanny White—you know

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Canada! Who’s talking about Canada? What’s that to
do—?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I was envious. She used to be with us at the
shop.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>impatiently.</i>] Yes, I know. Well, you’ve done
better than she, anyway, Maggie, if she <i>is</i> going to Canada. She’ll only be a
servant, after all. What else can she do? And then in the end she’ll marry some farmer man
and have to work fearfully hard—I’ve heard about the women over there—and wish she had
<i>never</i> left England. While here are you, going to marry a rich man who’s
<i>devoted</i> to you, with plenty of money and long holidays, and your own servant to

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>stretching a little and smiling.</i>] Isn’t it

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> <i>You’ll</i> never guess.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I thought you more brilliant, Mr. Leslie.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> I thought of the happiest thing that could happen to
a man, Miss Maggie.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> No, it’s not marrying. He’s going abroad.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Got a fortune?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He’s just going to try his luck. He’s emigrating.</p>

You surely don’t ask me to come and wish good luck to an ass?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You can help with a dirge then.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Much more like it. But, I say, is it really true? He
must have got something to go to?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> He hasn’t. He’s got a little cash, of course. He’s
always been a careful beast.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> And he’s going to throw it away! And then I suppose
he’ll be out of work over there, and we shall be hearing of the unemployment in the
Colonies! It’s just this sort of thing that makes a man a Conservative. It’s what I call
getting off the ladder and deliberately kicking it down.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Well, I don’t then. I think he’s a lucky chap to be

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> An advertisement. [<i>Reading.</i>] “Wanted, by Young
Man, board—residence in quiet family within easy reach of city. Western suburb preferred.”
I must answer it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I say—give Tennant a chance to get out first.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But he is going, dear, so there’s no risk. And it’s
such a good chance. Besides, we can ask Mr. Tennant for a reference.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>sharply.</i>] No, don’t. Surely we can exist a
week without anybody.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, yes! Only I thought—it’s a pity to miss—You don’t
want Mr. Tennant to go, do you, dear? He is nice company for you.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> He’s a nice chap. But you needn’t get lodgers to
keep me company.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>laughs.</i>] What an idea! Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>going to her and turning her face towards
him.</i>] I say, Lil, aren’t you ever dull here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> No—well—hardly ever. There’s always something to do.
What a question!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Don’t you ever get sick of it? It’s jolly hard work
sometimes. [<i>He takes her hands and looks at them, stroking them as if
unconsciously.</i>] Why they’re getting quite rough. [<i>She pulls them away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s the washing, dear. It does roughen your hands.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>taking them again and kissing them.</i>] They
weren’t rough when we married.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>she turns away.</i>] You silly boy, of course they
weren’t. I never did washing at home. What do you think, dear? Maggie is going to be
married.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>with little interest.</i>] To Foster?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Yes. Isn’t she lucky? He’s quite well off.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> So <i>she</i> won’t do the washing. I shall never be
rich.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’ll be head clerk one of these days.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> One of these days!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> And then we’ll have a servant.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Perhaps I shall never be head clerk.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, yes, you will!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I don’t know that I’m excited at the idea—a sort of
policeman over the other chaps. I’d rather be as I am.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But think of the position—and the money!</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> nods gloomily—he walks to
garden door.</p>

<p class="noindent">Where’s your ambition, dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Perfectly safe. No fear of that getting lost. The
man who built that road [<i>pointing out of the window</i>] ought to be hanged.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> They’re not very pretty, those houses. Mrs. Freeman
told me this morning that they’re going to raise our rents a little.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>turning round sharply.</i>] What?
<i>That’s</i><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
because they’ve brought the fares down. Just like ’em.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I was thinking this morning, dear, that perhaps we
could take two boarders. It would help a little. That little room at the back, over the
scullery, would do nicely with a single bed.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> That’s where I keep my cuttings and things.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Yes, dear, but you could have half the coal shed. We
never fill it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I don’t want the coal shed. I say—must we have
two?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It would make things better, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> But it’s beastly, choking up your house with a lot
of fellers. <i>You</i> don’t like it, do you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> No, dear, of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> You don’t seem much put out.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s no good being cross about it, dear, is it? If it’s
got to be done, we may as well make the best of it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, make the best of it. [<i>Fretfully.</i>] You
might at least seem vexed.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>patiently.</i>] Of course I don’t like it, dear,
and of course I’d much rather be alone with you and have all my house to myself—though
really the boarders don’t worry much, you know. They are always home late and only have
meals with us.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Who wants ’em at meals? I don’t, if you do!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>pathetically.</i>] You are very unkind. I never
said I wanted them. I’m only doing my best to make things smooth. You might help me,
Charley. [<i>She turns away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>crossing to <span class="name">LILY</span> and
patting her on her hand.</i>] I’ll be all right later. But I say it is a bit thick. An
Englishman’s home is his castle. I like that! Why, the only place where you can be alone
is<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span> the bedroom.
We’ll be letting that next. [<i>He laughs sarcastically.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>shocked.</i>] Charley! What are you saying?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Ha, ha, what a joke! The—well, never mind. The day
we let the bathroom, Lil—I’m off to the Colonies. [<i>He stops, suddenly struck with a
thought.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You silly boy.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Supposing I did, eh?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> We’re not going to let the bathroom, so you needn’t
suppose anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>abstractedly—sitting on a corner of the
table.</i>] Why not?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Did you speak, dear?</p>

<p class="scene"><i>SCENE: Sitting-room at </i>55<i> Acacia Avenue. The folding doors
between front and back parlour are opened, with red curtains looped up. The front parlour,
a glimpse of which is visible between curtains, is in full light and a corner of the piano
can be seen. The furniture in this room is of the imitation Sheraton variety. There is an
ornamental overmantel with photographs and vases, and a marble clock in the middle of the
mantelpiece.</i></p>

<p class="italics scene">Someone is playing the piano, and <span class="name">LILY,</span>
standing beside it, is singing in a sweet but rather weak voice, “Sing me to sleep.” No

LESLIE,</span> lolling on mantelpiece; <span class="name">SYBIL FROST,</span> a pretty
fair-haired girl, much given to laughing at everything; <span class="name">PERCY
MASSEY,</span> a good-looking, somewhat weak youth of perhaps twenty-one or twenty-two,
sitting very close to <span class="name">SYBIL,</span> and <span
class="name">TENNANT,</span> standing in the bay window.</p>

<p class="italics scene"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> comes in quietly through the
side door into the back parlour during the singing. When <span class="name">LILY</span>
comes to the refrain of the song, everyone except <span class="name">CHARLEY</span> joins
in. He stays in the back parlour and sitting down in the shadow, lights a cigarette. <span
class="name">LILY</span> sits down amid a good deal of clapping and words of
admiration.</p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> I do love that song.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Now you sing something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> [<i>with a giggle.</i>] I couldn’t really—you know I
couldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Oh, yes, you can—that nice little coon thing you sang
at the Richards.</p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> I’ve got a cold.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>crossing from piano.</i>] Of course you have.</p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> [<i>laughing.</i>] But it’s quite true. Really. And I
couldn’t really sing after Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Sybil! Do sing, <i>please.</i></p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> We’re all waiting, Miss Frost.</p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> Oh, please—I can’t. Let someone else sing first.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> comes to the doorway and

<span class="name">SYBIL</span> can be seen still resisting, while <span

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You here—all alone?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> ’Um.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Why didn’t you come into the front room?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I can hear quite as well here.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Got the hump?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> What for? Head’s a bit nasty, so I’m smoking it
off.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It isn’t that—it’s all this about Tennant.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>irritably.</i>] I’m not grieving over him, if
that’s what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> As if I did! and as if you’d confess if you were. Are
you sick of everything?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Sick! I’d cut the whole beastly show tomorrow if—
[<i>He stops suddenly.</i>]</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY’S</span> voice can be heard
distinctly from the front room.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Well, we’ll ask Mr. Tennant to sing first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> Oh, I can’t sing, really—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Why doesn’t the girl sing when she’s asked?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> She says she has a cold. [<i>She laughs a
little.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Rot! Affectation, I call it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Percy’s awfully smitten, isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>surprised.</i>] With her?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Of course. But you haven’t noticed that. Lily’s been
arranging it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> But he’s such a kid.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He’s twenty-two.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Lots of men marry at twenty-two.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> More fools they! Getting tied up before they’ve seen
anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>thoughtfully.</i>] I can never understand why a
man gets married. He’s got so many chances to see the world and do things—and then he goes
and marries and settles down and is a family man before he’s twenty-four.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> It’s a habit.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> If I were a man I wouldn’t stay in England another
week. I wouldn’t be a quill-driver all my life.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> gets up and walks
restlessly up and down the room.</p>

<p class="noindent">If I were a man—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Men can’t do everything.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I say, don’t you think it’s fine of Mr. Tennant to
throw up everything and take the risk?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I’d do the same if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>coming forward a little.</i>] Where’s Charley? Oh,
never mind, I daresay he’s got a lantern and is looking for worms or something. Are you
ready, Mr. Tennant?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I wonder what Lil would say if you did!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> stops dead and looks at
<span class="name">MAGGIE.</span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> If I <i>did?</i> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Why shouldn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Why shouldn’t I? Aren’t there a thousand
reasons?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> There’s Lily, certainly—but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> She wouldn’t understand. She’d think I was deserting
her.</p>

<p class="italics direction">A pause.</p>

<p class="noindent">But that’s not all. I might manage her—I don’t know—but—you see, I’ve
got a berth I can stay in all my life&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">TENNANT</span> starts singing the first
verse of “Off to Philadelphia.”</p>

<p class="noindent">It’s like throwing up a dead cert. And then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It <i>would</i> be a splash.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Yes—and think of all your people? What’d they say?
They’d say I was running away from Lil—of course, it would seem like
it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="italics direction">Another pause.</p>

<p class="noindent">It’s impossible. I might never get anything to do—and then—</p>

the chorus “With my Knapsack,” etc. Knock at front door.</p>

<p class="italics direction">She goes out in corridor as <span class="name">TENNANT</span>
commences the second verse.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> sits on the edge of the

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Mr. Fenwick didn’t want to come in when he heard all
the singing. He thought we had a party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p class="italics direction">She goes through curtains.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, it’s nothing—a sort of family sing-song.</p>

<p><span class="name"><span class="name">FENWICK.</span></span> Miss Massey would have me
come in—but really I’d rather come some other—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Stuff! Sit down. I’ll pull the curtains if it’s
anything special you’ve come about. I thought it was perhaps over those geranium cuttings.
Afterwards, if you feel like it, we’ll go and join them. [<i>Draws curtains and turns up
light.</i>] Freddy Tennant—you know him, don’t you—he’s going to seek his fortune in the
Colonies.</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> Is he?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Yes, and we’ll drink his health. What’s up?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> I didn’t see you at the train to-day.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> No, you were late. I came on with Malcolm.</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> The chief sent for me.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Wasn’t a rise, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> Do I look like it? It’s the other thing.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Docking?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> [<i>nodding first and then speaking slowly.</i>] He said
he’d sent for me as senior of my department. The company has had a bad year and they can’t
give the usual rises.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> None?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> None. Haven’t you had a letter?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> No. I say, have I got the sack?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> No, you haven’t. But they’re offering you the same
alternative they offered me—stay on at less—or go.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>walking up and down.</i>] What are you going to
do?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> What can I do? Stay, of course—what else is there?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Sit down under it?</p>

<p class="italics direction">Postman’s knock.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> There’s the postman. Wait a bit.</p>

<p class="italics direction">He goes out R. and the voices in the other room can be
distinctly heard laughing, while someone is playing a waltz tune very brilliantly.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> comes back with a letter in
his hand, closes door and music dies down.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Here it is. [<i>He opens and reads it, then throws
it on the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> A bit of a blow, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I didn’t expect it. Did you?</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Not until last week when Morgan started making
enquiries as to salaries, et cetera. Then I guessed.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> We can’t do anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> But I say, you know, it’s all rot about a bad year.
Don’t expect we’ve been exactly piling it up, but it’s nothing to grumble about.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> That doesn’t affect us, anyway. We’ve got to do as
we’re told. I fancy old Morgan is hit, too. He was sugary, but of course he had to obey
the instructions of the directors and so on.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> It’s no good swearing at him.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> It’s no good swearing at anybody. What’s a Board?
Where is it?</p>

<p class="italics direction">The curtains part and <span class="name">LILY</span> appears

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">FENWICK</span> rises; shake hands.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Good evening. I’m afraid I’m an awful nuisance, but
I just called to see your husband about a little business.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’ll stay to supper, won’t you? You and<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-28">[Pg 28]</a></span> Charley can sit and
talk business the whole time. I’m afraid Charley doesn’t like music very much—do you,
dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>big laugh from behind curtains.</i>] You should
hear Mr. Leslie. He’s so funny, he’s been giving Mr. Tennant advice what to do when he’s a
lonely bachelor in Australia. He made us <i>roar</i> with laughter.</p>

<p class="italics direction">Goes back laughing.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Silly ass!</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> [<i>startled.</i>] What?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> That chap Leslie! It’d do him good to go to
Australia for a bit. He’d stick to his berth if they docked his screw to ten bob. He’s got
no pride in him.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Well, we—at least, I—can’t say much—I’m going to
stay on. You, too, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>with a sort of defiance.</i>] Why should I?
What’s to hinder me leaving? Why shouldn’t I go to Morgan and say, “Look here—just tell
those directors that I won’t stand it! I’m not going to be put up or down—take this or
that—at their will and pleasure.”</p>

<p class="italics direction">There is a burst of laughter from the inner room.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> That’s all very well—and if you’ve got something
else—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>fiercely.</i>] I haven’t—not an idea of one—but
why should that hinder? Look at Tennant, he’s chucked his job and no one wanted to take
off anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> [<i>quite undisturbed.</i>] Tennant? Oh, he’s going
to the Colonies? Very risky. I nearly went there myself once.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Why didn’t you quite?</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Various things. All my people were against it. Oh,
well, what was the good of going? It was only a passing fancy, I daresay. Once you<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-29">[Pg 29]</a></span> leave a place the
chances are you won’t get another. There are so many of us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Of course, it’s safe and it’s wise and it’s sensible
and all that—but it’s <i>damnable.</i></p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> It’s come suddenly to you—I’ve almost got used to
the idea. [<i>With a little laugh.</i>] You do, you know, after a little. You’re
young.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [<i>With sigh.</i>] Well, there it is. [<i>A pause.</i>] But
I’d looked for that rise. It’ll make a difference. [<i>Pulling himself together.</i>]
However, it can’t be helped. We’ve got something left and I’m safe, and that’s more than a
good many people can say. I’m sorry I came tonight, Wilson.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LESLIE’S</span> voice can be heard,
shouting out a comic song.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<i>Smiling.</i>] Life doesn’t seem to worry him.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>with a short laugh.</i>] Neither do I, old chap.
Fact is, I was feeling a bit off when you came.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> You’re a little restless, but it’ll work off. Look

<p class="italics direction">They go out.</p>

<p class="italics direction">The curtains are pulled wide and <span

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> May we interrupt? [<i>Looking around.</i>] Empty was

<p class="italics direction">Re-enter <span class="name">CHARLEY.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Where’s the business?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Fenwick’s been, but he’s just gone.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Fenwick? Wasn’t cheerful company, was he?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>crossly.</i>] What’s the matter with him?</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> He never is, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> He isn’t exactly boisterous. He nearly emigrated
once, he tells me.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>coming forward.</i>] Why didn’t he quite?</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Not enough devil in him. Hundreds of ’em almost
go.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Did you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> [<i>with energy.</i>] I’m comfortable enough where I
am. I’ve been telling this chap here he’s a fool, but he won’t believe me. He says he’d
rather be a fool in the Colonies than a wise man here. Don’t know what he means quite, but
it sounds rather smart. [<i>Waving his pipe oracularly as he faces the three men.</i>]
I’ve known lots of chaps who’ve wanted to go. The guv’nor is unpleasant or there’s too
much overtime or they get jealous of their girl or something of that sort and off they
must go. I’ve known a few who went—and sorry they were, too. You can’t do anything out
there. Read the emigration books, read your papers. Failure all along the line. Market
overcrowded. Only capitalists need apply—the Colonies don’t want you—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Neither does England—</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Of course not but [<i>waving his arm
impressively</i>] but you’re here and got something. That’s the whole point. My advice
is—stick where you are. Tennant’s a stupid ass to give up a decent berth; he deserves to
fail. Of course, we should all like to see the world. <i>I</i> should—</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> It’s more than that.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Yes, yes, you don’t understand. It isn’t the idea of
travelling—it’s because you want to feel—oh! [<i>He stretches out his arms.</i>] I don’t
suppose you ever feel so—</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Can’t say I did.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Aren’t you ever sick of the thing, Leslie?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> And don’t you ever want to pitch all the ledgers
into the dustbin and burn the stools?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Never—though I’ve met many that have. I tell you,
it’s a good thing to have a safe berth nowadays. Many fellows would only be too glad to
pick up Tennant’s berth—or yours, Wilson. Think of the crowds that will answer the
advertisement at Molesey’s— Last week our firm wanted a man to do overtime work, and they
don’t pay too high a rate—I can tell you. They had five hundred and fifteen
applications—five hundred and fifteen! Think of that! And that’s what would happen to you
if you went, Wilson, and that’ll be the end of Tennant. Sorry to be unpleasant—but
truth—</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> But there’s room on the land—</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Land! What on earth can a bally clerk do with a

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Shut it, Leslie. You can’t call Tennant exactly
anæmic. And look at this. [<i>He strips off his coat and turns back his shirt sleeves to

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> All right for a back garden. I suppose you think

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>digging his hands into the pockets without

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p class="italics direction">Enter <span class="name">LILY</span>—she pulls down blind and

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I’m going up now. Don’t be long. You look so tired.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>irritably.</i>] Oh, don’t fret about me. I’m a
little worried, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>timidly.</i>] Did Mr. Fenwick bring bad news? He
looked miserable enough.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>looking at her steadily.</i>] Yes, I’m not going
to have that rise.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, dear—what a shame! Why?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Lots of reasons—but that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Of course, you’re worried. Still—it might have been
worse. You might have been sent away.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s very disheartening—after all we’d planned<span

won’t be able to have the greenhouse, now, will you, dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>with a short laugh.</i>] What’s the good of a
greenhouse in that yard. It isn’t that.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>a little timidly.</i>] But we can manage very well,
dear. We—you remember what I said this morning—about the other lodger.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, don’t, for heaven’s sake. It isn’t losing the
cash I mind; it’s having to give in like this. I want to go to them and tell them to do
their worst and get somebody else.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But dear, you might lose your place.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I should.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But that—we couldn’t afford that, could we? Why, we can
manage quite well as we are. I can be very careful still—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Never mind what I said. [<i>He kisses her and pets
her like a child.</i>] Come, go to bed. It’s the news—and the excitement about Tennant—and
all that. Come, go back to bed and I’ll be up in a few minutes.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> leads her to the door and
coaxes her outside and stands at the door a few seconds, then he comes back into the room,
stands still, looking round. He goes to the front parlour and hunts over the chairs and
the piano as if in search of something. Finally he picks up a paper off the floor and
brings to table—it is the map of Australia. He opens it on the table and leans over it,
his pipe unnoticed burning out in his left hand.</p>

<p class="italics scene">SCENE: The sitting-room at “Sunnybank,” Hammersmith. There is no
centre table, but there are various small ones against the wall and in the window. There
is a piano, a tall palm in the window, and one or two wicker chairs that creak. The rest
of the furniture is upholstered in saddlebags with antimacassars over the sofa head and
armchairs. Gramophone in the corner. Big mirror over mantelpiece. Gilt clock in glass case
and lustres.</p>

falls out. <span class="name">MRS. M.</span> turns her head.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m so sorry, Mother, I tried to poke it gently.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I was hardly asleep, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Mother!—you’ve been sleeping for half an hour!</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> It didn’t seem like it, dear. Why, your father’s
asleep.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Isn’t that extraordinary!</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>admiringly.</i>] How soundly he sleeps! What’s
the time?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Four o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> No, dear—of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I wouldn’t walk the streets this afternoon for any

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ll put on the kettle now and when Lil and Charley

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Mother, did you love father when you married him—very

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>much astonished.</i>] What a question! Of

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> More than any other man you’d ever seen?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Of course!</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> <i>Of course!</i></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Well, there’s something wrong with me, then—or else
with Walter. I don’t feel a bit like that. There’s no “of course” with me. I wouldn’t go
and sit in the Park with him this afternoon for anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I suppose you’ve quarrelled?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> No, we haven’t. I wish we had.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Maggie! Don’t talk like that.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> But I do. He wants me to marry him next month.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> And a very good thing too.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He says he’s found a house, and wants me to go and
look at it. <i>I</i> don’t want to see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> What’s come over you lately? You used to be
satisfied. Walter is very nice and attentive—in fact, quite devoted.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Yes, I know. Just like he was to his first wife, I
expect.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> You’ve such an absurd prejudice against widowers,
Maggie. You’re jealous.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m not. Not a bit. But I do wish he would do
something, and not worry about getting married.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> The poor man is doing something, I should think,
running after you every spare minute, and house hunting.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I would much rather he went to Australia—or
somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> That’s that absurd Tennant man again. You’re not in
love with <i>him,</i> I hope?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>promptly.</i>] Not a scrap! I find him rather
dull.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Then what is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I should like Walter to go out and seek his fortune
instead of getting it in a coal merchant’s office.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> He mightn’t come back.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>thoughtfully.</i>] Perhaps he wouldn’t.</p>

<p class="noindent">You’re shivering! Sit close to the fire. Aren’t you well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>in a pathetic voice.</i>] Yes, I’m well, thank
you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Are you alone?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley is coming on. He’s gone to the station with Mr.
Tennant.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> To see him off?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> No—Mr. Tennant goes to-morrow.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> goes out with hat and coat.
She brings back with her a tray, with cloth, etc., and prepares for tea on a small
table.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Have you got another lodger?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> No. We—we’ve got to have two.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Two? What for?</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> stops to listen.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> They’ve reduced Charley’s salary.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>sitting up energetically.</i>] Reduced it? What
for?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I don’t know—I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, I’m so
miserable. [<i>She suddenly covers her face with her hands and sobs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>stooping over her.</i>] Lil, dear, you’re not
crying over <i>that,</i> are you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>sobbing.</i>] Oh, no, no! It doesn’t matter. We can
make room for two lodgers quite well. I don’t mind the work.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Then what is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I suppose you and Charley have quarrelled?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Tell us, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley—wants—to go away—and leave me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> What? What’s this?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>looking apprehensively round at the sleeping
figure.</i>] Hush! don’t wake father!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He won’t wake till the tea-cups rattle. Charley wants
to leave <span class="smallerfont">YOU</span>!</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I <i>knew</i> they’d quarrelled.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> We haven’t—not exactly—but he’s been so<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-46">[Pg 46]</a></span> <i>funny</i> ever since
Mr. Tennant said he was going to Australia. He wants to go too.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> What next? Charley ought to be ashamed of himself. Go
to Australia indeed! He forgets he is married.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I don’t want him to stay just because he’s married, if
he wants to leave me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You are quite <i>wrong,</i> I’m sure, Lil. He doesn’t
want to leave you at all. He wants to leave his work.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Perhaps he does. So do other people very often.
Suppose we all stopped work when we didn’t like it? A pretty muddle the world would be in.
Charley is forgetting there is such a thing as duty.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> He’s very unhappy—and I—I can’t make him happy.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> So he ought to be miserable with such ideas in his
head. I never heard of such a thing! The sooner Mr. Tennant goes the better. He’s been
putting Charley up to this, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You don’t know Mr. Tennant, mother. He’s not that
sort.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Then what made Charley think of it at all?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It’s just a feeling you get sometimes, mother. You
can’t help it. Office work is awf’lly monotonous.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Of course it is. So is all work. Do you expect work
to be pleasant? Does anybody ever like work? The idea is absurd. Anyone would think work
was to be pleasant. You don’t come into the world to have pleasure. We’ve got to do our
duty, and the more cheerfully we can do it, the better for ourselves and everybody
else.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I—I didn’t mean to tell you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> He ought to be talked to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Don’t say anything, please—not yet. Perhaps after tea
we can all talk about it, and it may do him good.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> goes out. <span

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Tea?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Yes, Daddy.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> In here? There’s no room.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It’s cosey. I’ll bring yours to the sofa.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Where am I to put it?—on the floor?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ll bring up a table for you if you must have one.
You wouldn’t do for a Society gentleman. Can’t you balance a cup on your knee?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> I don’t mean to try. Hope you haven’t got out those
finnicky little cups. I want my own.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ve got your own—here. [<i>She holds up a very big
breakfast cup, plain white with gilt band.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> I didn’t hear you come in, Lil. Where’s Charley?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Coming on.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> What’ve you done with Foster, Mag?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He’s not coming.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> takes tea round.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Gone away for the week end?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>taking a cup for herself and sitting down beside
<span class="name">LILY.</span></i>] Oh, no! He’s not coming. That’s all. Lily and I are
grass widows. It’s a very nice feeling.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> It’s all right about you, but Lil looks a bit off.
You’ve got a cold. Your eyes are red.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Yes, father.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> You’ve dropped some bread and butter on the carpet,
Alfred.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>irritably.</i>] Of course I have! I knew I

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>his attention taken from his grievance.</i>]
What, in this weather?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> The seats will be dry and they sit close together,
you know. I’ve often seen them do it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>chuckling.</i>] You have, have you? And what
about yourself? What about yourself? You! Lord! what a nest of turtle doves it is—nothing
but billing and cooing!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Especially Percy.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> P’raps so. He’s young at it. Well, he’ll be the next,
I suppose. And you, too, Mag?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m in no hurry.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>a little impatiently to <span
class="name">MAGGIE.</span></i>] Don’t talk like that, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Of course she says she isn’t. She’s a modest young
woman—I never heard <i>you</i> say you were in a hurry, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Of course I shouldn’t—to you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Ha, ha! You put on the shy business then. Lord! these
women. [<i><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> moves towards table.</i>] Come, now, Mag,
confess! You think of it sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I think of it a lot.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> There you are! There you are! What did I say?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> And what do you think I think about it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> How should I know. Wedding, I suppose. I bet you
never think of anything else after the wedding day.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>slowly.</i>] I think of the wedding dress, and
the bridesmaids, and the pages. Shall I have pages, Mum?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Maggie!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I suppose I shan’t. I think of the house<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-49">[Pg 49]</a></span> I’m going to have,
Daddy—and the furniture, and I’m going to have a cat and a dog—</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>slyly.</i>] Nothing else, of course. Just a cat
and a dog. Ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Alfred, don’t suggest. It isn’t nice.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> A cat and dog—ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Don’t laugh, Daddy. I’m telling you the solemn
truth—I think most of all that I shall never, never, never have to go into a shop
again.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> I wish old Foster could hear you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> He’d say—“And where do I come in?”</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Well, of course he’ll be there. I wish—</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Maggie, my dear—I should like a little more tea! Have
you got some more hot water?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ll get some. [<i>Goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> It’s all very well for her to chaff, but she ain’t
quite natural about this affair of hers. She ought to be more pleased—excited like.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I think they’ve had a little quarrel. People often
do. She’s a little bit down about it. We’ve had a talk about it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Well, she can’t have any quarrel about him himself.
<i>He’s</i> all right, and got a jolly soft job, too. He’ll make her a good husband. He’s
insured for £500.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Is he? That’s very nice. If anything happened to him
she’d be all right.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> He’s a thoughtful sort of chap. Of course he’s not
exactly young, but he’s steady.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> The poor child is jealous of his first wife.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> You don’t say so? Jealous, is she? That’s all
right—that’s a healthy feeling. I’m glad she’s jealous, but she’ll get over it once she’s
married. Jealous! Lord! Fancy, Mag too—I wouldn’t have thought it. He’ll be head clerk,
one of these days—he can stay at Whitakers all his life. He told me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Do you think he’ll ever get tired of it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> What an idea!</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> A long time ago, but I’m quite safe now, dear.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> shrugs her shoulders and
turns half away impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I never said you couldn’t live them down. I never
said, did I, that I was going away? I only said I should like to. Did I ever say more,
Lil?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>meekly.</i>] No, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> But you shouldn’t want to. It’s ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> It wasn’t till Tennant started about his going—</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I knew it was that man Tennant—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that I thought of it. But if he
threw up his job, I thought, why shouldn’t I?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Because he’s a fool, you needn’t be another.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He’s not a fool, and I wish Charley could go,
too.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Maggie, how can you?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>crossing to fireplace.</i>] Why should a young
man be bound down to one trade all his life? I wish I were a man—I’d—</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Well, you’re not, so it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Of course it must make a difference my being
married.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Remember your wife’s here and don’t talk as if you
were sorry about it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>turning on them fiercely.</i>] For heaven’s

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p class="italics direction">A pause—nobody answers.</p>

<p class="noindent">But I’ll tell you what, marriage shouldn’t tie a man up as if he was a
slave. I don’t want to desert Lily—she’s my wife and I’m proud of it—but because I
married, am I never to strike out in anything? People like us are just cowards. We seize
on the first soft job—and there we stick, like whipped dogs. We’re afraid to ask for
anything, afraid to ask for a rise even—we wait till it comes. And when the boss says he
won’t give you one—do we up and say, “Then I’ll go somewhere where I can get more.” Not a
bit of it! What’s the good of sticking on here all our lives? Why shouldn’t somebody risk
something sometimes? We’re all so jolly frightened—we’ve got no spunk—that’s where the
others get the hold over us—we slog on day after day and when they cut our wages down we
take it as meek as Moses. We’re not men, we’re machines. Next week I’ve got my
choice—either to take less money to keep my job or to chuck it and try something else. You
say—everybody says—keep the job. I expect I shall—I’m a coward like all of you—but what I
want to know is, why can’t a man have a fit of restlessness and all that, without being
thought a villain?</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> But after all, we undertake responsibilities when we
marry, Mr. Wilson. We can’t overlook them.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I don’t want to. But I don’t think we ought to talk
as if when a man gets married he must always bring in just the same money.</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> If you have the misfortune to have your salary
reduced, nobody would blame you.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I don’t know. I felt a bit of a beast when I had to

you?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> I suppose you’re a Socialist.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Doesn’t anybody but a Socialist ever have an

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> They’re mostly mad, if that’s what you mean. And
they’re always talking about the wickedness of the boss and the sweetness of the working
man.</p>

<p class="italics scene"><span class="name">LILY</span> discovered, cutting sandwiches.
Ring at door. <span class="name">LILY</span> admits <span class="name">MAGGIE,</span> who
is dressed for the shop.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>rather nervously.</i>] You, Maggie! How early. What
is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ve come to help Mr. Tennant off, Lil. Where’s
Charley? Is he up?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, yes. [<i><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> goes to
the garden door and stands looking out.</i>] He’s been up a long while.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> So the great day has come. [<i>Turning.</i>] Is
Charley going, or isn’t he, Lil?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>nervously and avoiding <span
class="name">MAGGIE’S</span> eyes.</i>] No, of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Because—why, how can he? [<i>Tearfully.</i>] Don’t
speak in that tone, Maggie.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He would have decided to go, if you had encouraged
him.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I <i>did</i> encourage him. You heard me last night. I
told him—and I told him again after we got home—“If you want to go, I’ll never stand in
your way.”</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Yes, I heard. Is that how you told him last
night?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It doesn’t matter how I said it. He’ll get over it.
Everybody says he will—except you. And how could he go? It’s just an idea he’s got over
Mr. Tennant.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>angrily.</i>] Of course it’s Mr. Tennant.<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-66">[Pg 66]</a></span> Everybody speaks as if
Mr. Tennant was a wicked person going round tempting poor husbands to desert their wives.
“It’s all that Mr. Tennant.” “What a blessing when that man goes,” etc., etc., as if he
had a bad character. The truth is, that he’s done a jolly good thing. He’s stirred us all
up. He’s made us dissatisfied.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> What’s the good of that? Nobody can make things
different if they wanted to.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Don’t talk nonsense. Hasn’t he made things different
himself? [<i>Getting a little heroic.</i>] Heaps of fellows in London go on doing the same
old thing, in the same old way, only too glad if it’s safe. Look how everybody runs for
the Civil Service. Why? Because it’s safe, of course, and because they’ll get a pension.
Look at the post office clerks and Somerset House and lawyer’s clerks and bank clerks—</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Bank clerks don’t get pensions—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I know they don’t, but once in a bank, always in a
bank. Is there anything to look forward to—and aren’t they all just—exactly <i>alike?</i>
I once went past a lot of offices in the city—I don’t know what sort of offices they were.
But the windows had dingy drab blinds, and inside there were rows and <i>rows</i> of
clerks, sitting on high stools, bending over great books on desks. And over each there was
an electric light under a green shade. There they were scribbling away—and outside there
was a most beautiful sunset. I shall never, never, forget those men.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> They don’t have long hours.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> [<i>promptly.</i>] Nine to six.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I always thought it was ten to four.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Don’t you believe it. That’s what I thought once.
You’re thinking of the bank clerks, of course. My dear, the doors close at half-past three
or four—but the clerks—why, they never see the daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> In the summer they do.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>impressively.</i>] I don’t care what you say, or
what anybody says, it’s not right. And if the men have got used to it, it’s all the worse.
They want stirring up—and it’s the women who’ve got to do the stirring.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Whatever can <i>they</i> do?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Lots. It’s the women who make the men afraid. In the
old days the women used to help the men on with their armour and give them favours to
wear, and send them forth to fight. That’s the spirit we want now. Instead of that we say
to the men:—“I shouldn’t trouble, my dear, if I were you. You’re safe here. Do be
careful.”</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’re very unjust. Look at the Boer War, and how brave
the women were then.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> That isn’t the only kind of war. Is a soldier to be
the only kind of man, that a woman’s going to encourage? Can’t she help the man who wants
to make a better thing of life? Oh, what a lovely chance you had and didn’t take it,
Lil!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> How can you talk like that! What a fuss you’re making
over a little thing.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It wasn’t a little thing. Here is Charley, with all
sorts of “go” in him and fire and energy. Why couldn’t you go to him and say, “I’m proud
of you. Throw up the horrid business and go and seek your fortune.” It was all he wanted,
I do believe. Instead of which, he’s got every blessed person against him—wife,
mother-in-law, father-in-law, and all his friends and relations, and everything he can
have. Everybody thinks him mad.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> <i>You</i> ought to have married him, I should
think!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Don’t get spiteful, Lil!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Wait till you’re married yourself to Walter—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m not going to marry Walter.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>struck with astonishment.</i>] You’re not going to
marry Walter? Maggie!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ve broken it off. I did it last night.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Whatever for? Did you quarrel? You were a little touchy
last night, I thought—but Walter is so good tempered.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m sure it’s very good of him, but I don’t wish to
be forgiven and taken back. It was all through Mr. Tennant.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>anxiously.</i>] You don’t love <i>him?</i></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>exasperated.</i>] No, I’m not in love with
<i>anybody;</i> but all last week I was thinking and thinking, and it wasn’t till last
night that I found I was just marrying—to get away from the shop!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But he was <i>devoted</i> to you and so kind.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I don’t want kindness. My shopwalker is very kind
where I am, and I don’t see any need to change.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> How extraordinary you talk!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Well, when I heard Charley talking last night, I
thought what a fool I was to throw up one sort of—cage—for another.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But you <i>are</i> free when you’re married—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Nobody is—more especially the woman. But the thing
is, I shouldn’t want to be, if I loved the man. But I don’t love Walter, only his house.
Now, I can leave the shop any day, when I’ve saved enough—and run away. But I couldn’t run
away from Walter.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>horrified.</i>] Run away—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>suddenly beginning to laugh.</i>] Can you see me?
Running away from Walter? <i>Walter!</i> Oh! [<i>She laughs, but <span

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>surprised.</i>] Yes. Why? Coming to the

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> There’s another just after twelve—</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">TENNANT,</span> who has been swinging his

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>lowering his voice.</i>] Look here, old chap,

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>who keeps his voice rather low the whole time,

look out for me at Plymouth.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> But, Wilson—I say—you—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Don’t! It’s all settled. There’s no use arguing.
I’ve made up my mind. I’m going to leave here as usual and coming on by the second train
and pick you up at Plymouth. Don’t stare like that—I’ve thought it all out—</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> But your wife—your people here—you can’t do it. When
I’ve gone, you’ll get over it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Get over it? I’m not going to get over anything.
I’ve been a coward, see?—and now I’m going to cut and run. It’s no good telling
<i>Lil</i>—she wouldn’t understand—but when I’m out there and get something and making a
tidy little place for her, she’ll be all right. She’s nervous—the women are like that, you
know—they can’t help it—and her people, too—well, they’re old, and when you’re old, you’re
afraid.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>interrupting.</i>] You mean to go! to-day?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Why not? Why not? If I put it off, I’ll never go. It
wants a bit of doing, and if you don’t do these things at the time, well, you give in.
I’ve packed a bag with some things—I did it this morning.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> That’s why you were up so early—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I have written a note to Lil.

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It means such a lot, of course.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Courage or cheek—I don’t know which. Of course, it’s

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You’re not a fool. It’s the others who’re fools. If

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>impatiently.</i>] Oh, dear, NO. I’m not pining
for him. But I found out, when there was all this talk about Mr. Tennant, that I was
marrying Walter, because I wanted to be safe and was afraid of risk. Then I made up my
mind I wouldn’t do that. I tell you because—if a girl can risk things—surely a man—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> There wasn’t any risk for you with Walter. I can’t
see it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> A woman isn’t tested in the same way as a man. It’s
the only way I have—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Well, you know best, and if you don’t like him—but
everybody thought you did. I must say you’ve been rather hard on Foster. You led him on. I

Mag! What would you really think of me if I did?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> What? [<i>Looks at him for a second.</i>]
Charley—will you—after all?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Supposing I don’t give in—supposing I did go—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Are you sure about Lil—I’m ready to throw up

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I would look after her—she would be all right in a

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> But if I go it must be at once—at once, you
understand.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Yes, yes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> And if Lil thinks me a brute beast for leaving her

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> This way? I don’t—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I’m going to-day, Mag. I’ve arranged everything. I
couldn’t stand it. I had to go. I’ve written to Lil. She’ll be all right for money—I’ve
thought of that and I shall soon send for her. I know I shall, and then she’ll be glad I
did it. I look a brute, but, Mag, it’s got to be. [<i>Postman’s knock on front door.</i>]

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>suddenly turning from his breakfast.</i>]
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I’ve been thinking, dear, that we shall feel a little

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh—no—I don’t think so—</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Shall we ask the Leslies for whist?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>rising.</i>] No—not them—it doesn’t matter,
Lil—unless you’d rather.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, I shall be quite happy at home, by ourselves. I am
so glad you would prefer that, dear. [<i>She goes up to him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I haven’t been up to much in the company line
lately, have I?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’ll be better now, dear. What time shall you be

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> OK—er—you know my usual—</p>

<p>The following changes were noted:</p>

<ul>
<li>p. 2: <span class="name">LILY.</span> Who’s Poppy, dear.—Changed period to a question
mark.</li>

<li>p. 7: I’ve er—got some news for you.—Inserted dash after “I’ve”.</li>

<li>p. 12: You are quite free to do as you like, aren’t’ you, Mr. Tennant?—Deleted
apostrophe after “aren’t”.</li>

<li>p. 15: [<i>lifting the curtain and coming forward with Leslie.</i>]—Changed
“<i>Leslie</i>” to unitalicized all caps.</li>

<li>p. 31: <span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> (<i>digging his hands into the
pockets…</i>—Changed opening parenthesis to opening bracket for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 36: [<i>To Charley.</i>] You must have something hot…—Changed “<i>Charley</i>” to
unitalicized all caps.</li>

<li>p. 45: <i>She brings back with her a tray, with cloth, etc.. and prepares for tea on a
small table.</i>—Changed second period after “<i>etc</i>” to a comma.</li>

<li>p. 48: <span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>a little impatiently to
Maggie.</i>]—Changed “<i>Maggie</i>” to unitalicized all caps.</li>

<li>p. 54: The work is not too hard, But you like change.—Changed comma after “hard” to a
period.</li>

<li><a id="tnote_page-63" class="no_dec" href="#tnote_page-63_ref">p. 63:</a> Added stage
direction: “<i><span class="name">LILY</span> and <span class="name">MRS. MASSEY</span> go
out.</i>”—A few lines after Lily says “I’m quite ready to go”, there is a stage direction
for Lily and Mrs. Massey to re-enter, but the source text has no direction indicating
their exit. A stage direction indicating their exit was added right after Lily’s
line.</li>

<li>p. 78: <i><span class="name">LIL</span> goes out, and re-enters a moment after with
<span class="name">MAGGIE.</span></i>—Changed “<span class="name">LIL</span>” to “<span
class="name">LILY</span>”.</li>

<li>p. 80: <i><span class="name">LILY</span> runs to the door.</i> Good-bye.—Placed line
of dialogue (“Good-bye.”) on a separate line from the preceding stage direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some inconsistencies in the source text have been noted but allowed to stand as-is. For
example, Lily’s husband’s name is spelled both “Charley” and “Charlie.” On p. 58, Mrs.
Massey says, “Sybil told me distinctly this afternoon that Charley wanted to go to
Australia.” She is clearly referring to Lily, but the line has been left as printed.</p>

<p>The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the printed text.
However, some concessions have been made. For example, all stage directions were indented
the same amount from the left margin and coded as hanging paragraphs.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
