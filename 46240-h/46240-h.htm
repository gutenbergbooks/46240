<h4 class="ActI" id="Act_One"><a class="no_dec" href="#Act_One_toc">ACT I</a></h4>

<p class="scene"><i>SCENE: Sitting-room at </i>55<i> Acacia Avenue. The principal articles
of furniture are the centre table, set for dinner for three, and a sideboard on the right.
There are folding doors at the back, leading to the front room, partly hidden by curtains;
on the left a low French window leading into the garden. On the right is a fire burning;
and above it a door into the kitchen.</i></p>

<p class="scene italics">The furniture of the room is a little mixed in style. A wicker
armchair is on one side of the fireplace, a folding carpet-chair on the other. The other
chairs, three at the table and two against the walls, are of bent wood. The sideboard is
mahogany. The carpet-square over oilcloth is of an indeterminate pattern in subdued
colours, dull crimson predominating. Lace curtains at window. Family photographs, a
wedding group and a cricket group, and a big lithograph copy of a Marcus Stone picture,
are on the walls. There is a brass alarm clock on the mantelpiece and one or two
ornaments. A sewing-machine stands on a small table near the window; and on the edge of
this table and on the small table on the other side of the window are pots of cuttings. A
couple of bookshelves hang over the machine. A small vase of flowers stands in the centre
of the dinner table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="scene italics"><span class="name">LILY WILSON,</span> much worried, is laying
the centre table. She is a pretty, slight woman, obviously young, wearing a light cotton
blouse, dark skirt and big pinafore. The front door is heard to close. <span
class="name">CHARLEY WILSON</span> enters. He is an ordinary specimen of the city clerk,
dressed in correct frock-coat, dark trousers, carefully creased, much cuff and a high
collar.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Here you are, then. [<i>She puts up her face and they
kiss hurriedly.</i>] Did I hear Mr. Tennant with you?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Met on the step.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> <i>How</i> funny! Well, that’s nice. We can have dinner
almost directly.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>putting down his hat carefully on sideboard, and
stretching himself slowly, with evident enjoyment.</i>] Saturday, thank the Lord!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>laughing prettily.</i>] Poor thing!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>looking at his silk hat.</i>] I should like to
pitch the beastly thing into the river. [<i>He shakes his fist at it. Then he stretches
his neck as if to lift it out of the collar and shaking down his cuffs till he can get a
fine view of them, regards them meditatively.</i>] Pah!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>anxiously.</i>] What’s the matter with them? Are
they scorched?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Scorched! No, they’re white enough. Beastly
uniform!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But you must wear cuffs, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> A chap came to the office to-day in a red tie. Old
Raffles had him up, and pitched into him. Asked him if he was a Socialist. Chap said he
wasn’t, but liked red. “So do I,” says the Boss, “but I don’t wear a golf coat in the
city!” Thought he was awfully smart, and it did make Poppy swear.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Who’s Poppy, dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Popperwell. He almost left there and then. Said he
should wear whatever tie he liked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It would have been rather silly of him, wouldn’t it?
He’s so sure there.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> That’s what <i>he</i> said. He thought better of it and
swallowed it. Well—dinner ready?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Waiting.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>going out.</i>] I’ll be down in a jiffy.</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">LILY</span> goes to the fire. <span
class="name">TENNANT</span> heard outside whistling a bar of the song “Off to
Philadelphia.” He comes in. He is a broad-shouldered young fellow, a little shy in his
manner with women.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Nice day, Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I’ve brought you home the paper, if you’d like it.
It’s the “Daily Mirror.”</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, thank you. I do like the pictures. Charley is
getting so dreadfully serious now in his reading, and won’t buy it. He takes the “Daily
Telegraph.” He thinks the gardening notes are so good.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> He’s luxurious. It’s a penny.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, he shares it with somebody. [<i>Pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> How goes the garden?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s rather trying—I should like to give up those peas
and things, and have chickens. They would be so useful.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY</span> goes out. <span
class="name">TENNANT</span> takes a map out of his pocket and stands studying it. <span
class="name">CHARLEY</span> and <span class="name">LILY</span> enter together. <span
class="name">CHARLEY</span> has made a wonderful change into a loose, rather creased suit
of bright brown, flannel shirt with soft collar, flowing tie and old slippers. A pipe is
sticking out of one pocket, and a newspaper out of the other. They sit down, and <span
class="name">LILY</span> tries not to look worried as <span class="name">CHARLEY</span>
laboriously cuts the small joint which she has brought in with her and put before him. He
splashes the gravy a little and has to use the sharpener. <span class="name">LILY</span>
serves vegetables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> I think I shall get one of Robertson’s pups.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It would be lovely.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> He’s got one he’ll let me have cheap.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I saw them last night. They’re a good breed. Make
fine house-dogs.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> That’s what you want round here. A quiet neighbourhood
like this is A&nbsp;1 for burglars.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You don’t think we shall have any, do you?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> No. 24 had ’em the other night.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> What were they after?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> 24? That’s the new people. What a shame!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Wanted the wedding presents.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> And Mrs. Thompson told me they had real silver at
24.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Trust the burglars for knowing that. They won’t risk
their skins for electro. So <i>we</i> shan’t have ’em.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley! You forget the biscuit barrel and the
tray.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Where’s the Bobby?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> There’s only one about here.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> They don’t have Bobbies for burgles in these sort of
places, only for rows. And we don’t have rows. We’re too respectable.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I think it’s so mean of burglars to come to people like
us.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>with a burst of laughter.</i>] Let ’em go to
Portman Square, you say?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Well, of course, it’s wrong to steal at all; but it
doesn’t seem quite so bad. [<i>She stops, a little confused.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Of course it isn’t.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>lying back comfortably in his chair.</i>] Going
away Sunday?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No—the fact is—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Maggie is coming round this afternoon. Shall we ask the
Leslies for whist to-night?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> All right. Don’t make it too early, though. [<i>Looking
out of the French windows into the garden.</i>] I’ve got to get in my peas.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Green peas?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Green peas in that patch? My dear chap, don’t I wish I
could!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>to <span class="name">TENNANT.</span></i>] Have
some more?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No, thanks.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> For one thing, there’s the soil! It’s rotten. Then
there’re the sparrows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Some of them are so tame, dear, and they don’t seem to
care a bit for the cat next door.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>bitterly.</i>] They don’t care for anything. I wish
they’d take a fancy to a few snails.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> They don’t eat snails.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> You spoil ’em. She gives ’em soaked bread all through
the winter, and then expects me to grow things. Lord!</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY</span> collects plates. <span
class="name">TENNANT</span> goes out. <span class="name">CHARLEY</span> lights pipe. <span
class="name">CHARLEY</span> goes to window, where he stands leaning against the post and
smoking.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> The baby across the road is such a darling,
Charley.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> The girl was out with it this morning, and I called her
over.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s a boy.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY’S</span> replies are without
interest and he continues to gaze out into garden.</p>

<p class="noindent">They’re going to call him Theodore Clement Freeman. It’s rather a lot,
isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> What’s he got it all for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> After her father and his father and Freeman is a family
name.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> What did they want to give ’em all to <i>him</i> for?
They should keep some for the next.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> It’s silly. Still, it’s their business.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It might be a girl.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Well—there’s the others.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> My dear girl, why not?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I don’t like you to speak like that.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> I— [<i>Stops suddenly, looks at her, and comes over. He
takes her face between his hands.</i>] You silly! [<i>Kisses her.</i>]</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY</span> goes out with a tray of things
singing. <span class="name">CHARLEY</span> rolls up his sleeves and goes into the
garden.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">TENNANT</span> comes in and looks round.
<span class="name">CHARLEY</span> comes to the window with a spade.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> You—er—busy?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>lighting his pipe.</i>] Um! Want a job? There’s a
nice little lot of squirming devils under that flower-pot that want killing. Take your
time over it.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Thanks. My fancy doesn’t lie in gardening.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Filthy soil, this.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Mrs. Wilson would like to keep chickens.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Not if I know it! I’d rather go into a flat.
[<i>Leaning against the door and smoking thoughtfully.</i>] I could chuck the lot
sometimes. These two-penny-halfpenny back yards make me sick.</p>

<p class="italics direction">Pause.</p>

<p class="noindent">I’d give something for a piece of good land. Something to pay you for
your labour. [<i>Rousing.</i>] Well—going out?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>uneasily.</i>] Yes—presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>turning to look at him.</i>] What’s up?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I’ve—er—got some news for you.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Anything wrong?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No—no! The fact is—I’m going to hook it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>astonished.</i>] Hook it? Where to?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I’m sick of the whole show. I can’t stand it any
longer.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>trying to realise the situation.</i>] Do you mean
you’ve left Molesey’s?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Yes. I’m going to leave England—and so, you see,
I’ve got to leave here—your place.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Leave England? Got a crib?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> What are you going for then?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Because I’m sick of it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> So am I, and so are others. Do you mean you are just
going out because you want a change?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> That’s about it. I’ve had enough of grind.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Well, perhaps you’ll get grind somewhere else.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> It’ll be a change of grind then. That’s
something.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Canada?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No, Australia.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Phew! That’s a long shot. Got any friends there?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> It’s a bit risky, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Of course it’s risky. But who wouldn’t have a little
risk instead of that beastly hole every day for years? Scratch, scratch, scratch, and
nothing in the end, mind you?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>ironically.</i>] You might become a junior
partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>ignoring the remark.</i>] Suppose I stay there.
They’ll raise the screw every year till I get what they think is enough for me. Then you
just stick. I suppose I should marry and have a little house somewhere, and grind on.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>looking round.</i>] Like me.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY</span> heard singing off R.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No offence, old chap. It’s all right for some. It
suits you. You’re used to it. I want to see things a bit before I settle.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> is silent. His pipe has
gone out and he is staring at the floor.</p>

<p class="noindent">So I thought I’d go the whole plunge. I’ve got a little cash, of
course, so I shan’t starve at first, anyhow.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> makes no remark. <span
class="name">TENNANT</span> becomes apologetic.</p>

<p class="noindent">I’m—I feel a bit of a beast—but the fact is—I—it was decided in a
hurry—I—er—</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> looks up.</p>

<p class="noindent">I’m going on Monday.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> On Monday! Why, that’s the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Yes, I know. It was like this. I heard of a man
who’s going Monday—a man I know—and it came over me all at once, why shouldn’t I go too? I
went to see him Friday—kept it dark here till I’d seen the guv’nor, and now it’s all
fixed. I’m awfully sorry to have played you like this—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Oh, rot! That’s nothing. But I say, it’s the rummest go
I ever heard of. What did Molesey say?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Slapped me on the back! What d’ye think of that? I
thought he’d call me a fool. He pointed out that I could stay there for ever, if I
liked—which was jolly decent of him—but when I said I’d rather not, thanks muchly, he
banged me on the back,<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[Pg
9]</a></span> and said he wished he could do the same and cut the office. He didn’t even
stop the money for notice.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>laughing.</i>] You don’t want much. The old chap

<p class="italics direction">Pause.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<i>Rising.</i>] The thing is—I can’t see why I didn’t go before. Why
did I ever go into the beastly office? There was nobody to stop me going to Timbuctoo, if
I liked. I say, will you tell Mrs. Wilson?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> She’s only in the kitchen. Lil!—Lil!

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>studying <span class="name">TENNANT</span>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>nervously.</i>] I—I’m going to leave you, Mrs.

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Good Heavens, no! Not that!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Whatever made you think of that?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> What else could he do?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I’m going abroad.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Have you got a good appointment, Mr. Tennant?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No, nothing. I’m going on the chance.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Whatever for? Didn’t you like Molesey’s?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Oh, they were good enough and all that, but I got
sick of the desk. I’m going farming.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> And throwing up a good situation?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I suppose you’d call it good.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It was so sure. You’d have been head clerk in time. I’m
sure you would. It does seem such a pity.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Sounds a bit foolish, I expect.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Of course you must get tired of it sometimes. But to
throw it up altogether! I do hope you won’t be sorry for it. Charley gets tired of it
sometimes—don’t you, dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>from the garden door.</i>] Just a bit—now and
then.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Everybody does I expect. It would be very nice, of
course, to see other places and all that—but you can always travel in your holidays.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> How far on the Continong can you go in a fortnight,
Lil?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I don’t think you quite understand. It isn’t so much
that I want to see things—though that’d be jolly—but I want a change of work.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>sympathetically.</i>] It <i>is</i> trying to do the
same thing over and over again. But then the hours are not so very long, are they?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Nine to six, with an hour for lunch and tea thrown in.
Count your many blessings, Freddy.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>reproachfully, and crossing to him.</i>] You know,
Charley, we’ve often talked it over, and you’ve said how regular the hours were.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> It’s the spring, Freddy. That’s the matter with

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I do hope you won’t be sorry for it. It would be so

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>hastily and with much embarrassment.</i>] Oh,

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> And we have always got on so very well together. I’m

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He’s going to be married?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Good Lord! There’s another.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Hullo, Charles, you there!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> How nice for him!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>emphatically.</i>] Nice! But he’s got nothing to do

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Yes; I’m going to Australia to try my luck.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Isn’t he an idiot?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Throwing up a nice snug little place at Molesey’s and
rushing himself on to the already overstocked labour market of the Colonies.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You are really going on your luck?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> How fine!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Maggie! Think of the risk!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He’s a man. It doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> If he’d been out of work, it would have been so very
different.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> That would have spoilt the whole thing. I admire his
pluck.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Well, he’s got no one depending on him, so he will
suffer alone.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You’re not very encouraging, Lil. I have heard of a
married man doing the same.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>quickly.</i>] Who was that?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> How very foolish!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Oh, he was already out of work.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> That is different—although even then—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> His wife went to live with her people again and he
went out to the Colonies and made a home for her.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>sceptically.</i>] How did he do that?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I don’t know. <i>You</i> are quite free to do as you
like, aren’t you, Mr. Tennant? How does that feel?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I have only just started to think about it. Directly

<p class="italics direction">Pause.</p>

<p class="italics direction">Enter from the garden <span class="name">MORTON
LESLIE,</span> a big fair man, clean-shaven, lazy and good-natured. <span

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> I nearly smashed your husband, Mrs.

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> If you don’t the birds will—and if they don’t the worms

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> I thought it was such an excellent Small Holding!
What about the carrots?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Pah! Carrots! Why not peaches? Come on, Leslie! I’ve
got the papers in the other room.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> lifts the curtain and they
go into front room.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I’m afraid Charley must be tired. He seems quite
irritable.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> So am I when I get home from business. [<i>Throwing
out her arms and smiling at <span class="name">LILY.</span></i>] No more shop for me in a

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> nods.</p>

<p class="noindent">Oh, how lovely! How nice for you, dear! I am so glad. What did mother
say?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>with a little laugh.</i>] Mother is charmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Everybody is, of course. He is such a nice man. He will

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Yes, I suppose I am.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You don’t like to show it, of course, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Don’t I? You should have seen me last night! I took
off my shop collar and apron and put them on the floor and danced on them—till mother came
to see what was the matter.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You <i>must</i> be fond of him, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> No, I’m <i>not,</i> particularly.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Maggie!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>walking up and down.</i>] That’s funny now. I
didn’t mean to say that. It just came. [<i>A pause.</i>] How queer! [<i>A pause.</i>]
Well, it’s the truth, anyway. At least, it’s not quite true. When I came here to-day I was
awfully happy about it—I am fond of him at least—I—well—he’s very nice—you know.
[<i>Irritably.</i>] What did you want to start this for, Lil?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>aggrieved.</i>] <i>I</i> start it? I did
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I was so satisfied when I came.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>soothingly and taking her sister’s hat and coat

your ring, dear?</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> holds out her left hand.</p>

<p class="noindent">How sweet! Sapphires! He must be rich, Maggie.</p>

<p class="italics direction">Pause.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I wish I was a good housekeeper, Lil.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>reassuring.</i>] Oh, you’ll soon learn, dear; and
his other housekeeper wasn’t very good.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I wasn’t thinking of that.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But you talked of housekeeping, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Yes, but that’s quite different from being married.
If I could cook decently, I would have left the shop before.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But you <i>are</i> going to leave the shop!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>unheeding.</i>] Or if I understood anything about
the house properly, but I couldn’t be even a mother’s help unless I could wash.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I don’t know what you mean, Maggie. You haven’t got to
wash. You know Mr. Foster can afford to send it all out. [<i>Sighing enviously.</i>] That
must be nice.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I heard of a girl the other day, Fanny White—you know
her—she’s gone to Canada.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Canada! Who’s talking about Canada? What’s that to
do—?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I was envious. She used to be with us at the
shop.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>impatiently.</i>] Yes, I know. Well, you’ve done
better than she, anyway, Maggie, if she <i>is</i> going to Canada. She’ll only be a
servant, after all. What else can she do? And then in the end she’ll marry some farmer man
and have to work fearfully hard—I’ve heard about the women over there—and wish she had
<i>never</i> left England. While here are you, going to marry a rich man who’s
<i>devoted</i> to you, with plenty of money and long holidays, and your own servant to
begin with! Really, Maggie—!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>stretching a little and smiling.</i>] Isn’t it
gorgeous? [<i>shaking herself.</i>] Well—it must be Mr. Tennant’s fault. He shouldn’t get
mad ideas into his head—</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> And he really is mad. Throwing up a most
<i>excellent</i> situation. My dear, I call him just stupid!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>lifting the curtain and coming forward with
<span class="name">LESLIE.</span></i>] There’s no hurry.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Oh, I’ll start on it to-night. My wife’s gone away
and left me for the day, and I’m a forsaken grass widower.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>laughing.</i>] Poor Mr. Leslie! Won’t you come in
here to-night? Don’t you think it would be<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Tennant? Where’s he going?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> <i>You’ll</i> never guess.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> He’s leaving you? He’s going to get married?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>impatiently.</i>] You’re as bad as a woman!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I thought you more brilliant, Mr. Leslie.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> I thought of the happiest thing that could happen to
a man, Miss Maggie.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> No, it’s not marrying. He’s going abroad.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Got a fortune?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He’s just going to try his luck. He’s emigrating.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> What a fool! He’s got the sack, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> No. He’s thrown it up.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Thrown up a safe job? Oh, he’s an ass, a stupid ass!
You surely don’t ask me to come and wish good luck to an ass?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You can help with a dirge then.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Much more like it. But, I say, is it really true? He
must have got something to go to?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> He hasn’t. He’s got a little cash, of course. He’s
always been a careful beast.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> And he’s going to throw it away! And then I suppose
he’ll be out of work over there, and we shall be hearing of the unemployment in the
Colonies! It’s just this sort of thing that makes a man a Conservative. It’s what I call
getting off the ladder and deliberately kicking it down.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Well, I don’t then. I think he’s a lucky chap to be
able to do something he likes. He’s got some pluck.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Why, dear, you know you think it’s very silly of
him!</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> [<i>laughing.</i>] You must look after your<span

<p class="italics direction">They go out. A crash is heard.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> Hullo! What’s up?</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> [<i>in the distance.</i>] Smashed a box of tomato
plants. Phew!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHAR.</span> [<i>who is practically lying over the map.</i>] Not

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No. If ever you thought of that—see—this is a good

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>glancing round.</i>] What is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> An advertisement. [<i>Reading.</i>] “Wanted, by Young

I must answer it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I say—give Tennant a chance to get out first.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But he is going, dear, so there’s no risk. And it’s
such a good chance. Besides, we can ask Mr. Tennant for a reference.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>sharply.</i>] No, don’t. Surely we can exist a
week without anybody.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, yes! Only I thought—it’s a pity to miss—You don’t
want Mr. Tennant to go, do you, dear? He is nice company for you.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> He’s a nice chap. But you needn’t get lodgers to

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>laughs.</i>] What an idea! Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>going to her and turning her face towards

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> No—well—hardly ever. There’s always something to do.
What a question!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Don’t you ever get sick of it? It’s jolly hard work
sometimes. [<i>He takes her hands and looks at them, stroking them as if

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s the washing, dear. It does roughen your hands.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>taking them again and kissing them.</i>] They
weren’t rough when we married.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>she turns away.</i>] You silly boy, of course they
weren’t. I never did washing at home. What do you think, dear? Maggie is going to be
married.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>with little interest.</i>] To Foster?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Yes. Isn’t she lucky? He’s quite well off.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> So <i>she</i> won’t do the washing. I shall never be
rich.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’ll be head clerk one of these days.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> One of these days!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> And then we’ll have a servant.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Perhaps I shall never be head clerk.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, yes, you will!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I don’t know that I’m excited at the idea—a sort of

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But think of the position—and the money!</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> nods gloomily—he walks to
garden door.</p>

<p class="noindent">Where’s your ambition, dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Perfectly safe. No fear of that getting lost. The
man who built that road [<i>pointing out of the window</i>] ought to be hanged.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> They’re not very pretty, those houses. Mrs. Freeman
told me this morning that they’re going to raise our rents a little.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>turning round sharply.</i>] What?
<i>That’s</i><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
because they’ve brought the fares down. Just like ’em.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I was thinking this morning, dear, that perhaps we
could take two boarders. It would help a little. That little room at the back, over the
scullery, would do nicely with a single bed.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> That’s where I keep my cuttings and things.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Yes, dear, but you could have half the coal shed. We
never fill it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I don’t want the coal shed. I say—must we have
two?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It would make things better, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> But it’s beastly, choking up your house with a lot
of fellers. <i>You</i> don’t like it, do you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> No, dear, of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> You don’t seem much put out.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s no good being cross about it, dear, is it? If it’s
got to be done, we may as well make the best of it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, make the best of it. [<i>Fretfully.</i>] You
might at least seem vexed.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>patiently.</i>] Of course I don’t like it, dear,
and of course I’d much rather be alone with you and have all my house to myself—though
really the boarders don’t worry much, you know. They are always home late and only have
meals with us.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Who wants ’em at meals? I don’t, if you do!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>pathetically.</i>] You are very unkind. I never
said I wanted them. I’m only doing my best to make things smooth. You might help me,
Charley. [<i>She turns away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>crossing to <span class="name">LILY</span> and
patting her on her hand.</i>] I’ll be all right later. But I say it is a bit thick. An
Englishman’s home is his castle. I like that! Why, the only place where you can be alone
is<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span> the bedroom.
We’ll be letting that next. [<i>He laughs sarcastically.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>shocked.</i>] Charley! What are you saying?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Ha, ha, what a joke! The—well, never mind. The day
we let the bathroom, Lil—I’m off to the Colonies. [<i>He stops, suddenly struck with a
thought.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You silly boy.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Supposing I did, eh?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> We’re not going to let the bathroom, so you needn’t
suppose anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>abstractedly—sitting on a corner of the
table.</i>] Why not?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Did you speak, dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>starting.</i>] Eh?—No, no!—nothing.</p>

<p class="scene"><i>SCENE: Sitting-room at </i>55<i> Acacia Avenue. The folding doors
between front and back parlour are opened, with red curtains looped up. The front parlour,
a glimpse of which is visible between curtains, is in full light and a corner of the piano
can be seen. The furniture in this room is of the imitation Sheraton variety. There is an
ornamental overmantel with photographs and vases, and a marble clock in the middle of the
mantelpiece.</i></p>

<p class="italics scene">Someone is playing the piano, and <span class="name">LILY,</span>
standing beside it, is singing in a sweet but rather weak voice, “Sing me to sleep.” No
one is in the back parlour, but through the curtains can be seen <span class="name">MORTON
LESLIE,</span> lolling on mantelpiece; <span class="name">SYBIL FROST,</span> a pretty
fair-haired girl, much given to laughing at everything; <span class="name">PERCY
MASSEY,</span> a good-looking, somewhat weak youth of perhaps twenty-one or twenty-two,
sitting very close to <span class="name">SYBIL,</span> and <span
class="name">TENNANT,</span> standing in the bay window.</p>

<p class="italics scene"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> comes in quietly through the
side door into the back parlour during the singing. When <span class="name">LILY</span>
comes to the refrain of the song, everyone except <span class="name">CHARLEY</span> joins
in. He stays in the back parlour and sitting down in the shadow, lights a cigarette. <span
class="name">LILY</span> sits down amid a good deal of clapping and words of
admiration.</p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> I do love that song.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Now you sing something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> [<i>with a giggle.</i>] I couldn’t really—you know I
couldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Oh, yes, you can—that nice little coon thing you sang
at the Richards.</p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> I’ve got a cold.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>crossing from piano.</i>] Of course you have.</p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> [<i>laughing.</i>] But it’s quite true. Really. And I
couldn’t really sing after Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Sybil! Do sing, <i>please.</i></p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> We’re all waiting, Miss Frost.</p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> Oh, please—I can’t. Let someone else sing first.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> comes to the doorway and
catches sight of <span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> She comes in. In the front parlour
<span class="name">SYBIL</span> can be seen still resisting, while <span
class="name">LILY,</span> <span class="name">LESLIE,</span> and <span class="name">PERCY
MASSEY</span> beseech her.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You here—all alone?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> ’Um.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Why didn’t you come into the front room?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I can hear quite as well here.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Got the hump?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> What for? Head’s a bit nasty, so I’m smoking it
off.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It isn’t that—it’s all this about Tennant.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>irritably.</i>] I’m not grieving over him, if
that’s what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> As if I did! and as if you’d confess if you were. Are
you sick of everything?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Sick! I’d cut the whole beastly show tomorrow if—
[<i>He stops suddenly.</i>]</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LILY’S</span> voice can be heard
distinctly from the front room.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Well, we’ll ask Mr. Tennant to sing first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">SYBIL.</span> Oh, I can’t sing, really—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Why doesn’t the girl sing when she’s asked?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> She says she has a cold. [<i>She laughs a
little.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Rot! Affectation, I call it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Percy’s awfully smitten, isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>surprised.</i>] With her?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Of course. But you haven’t noticed that. Lily’s been
arranging it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> But he’s such a kid.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He’s twenty-two.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Lots of men marry at twenty-two.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> More fools they! Getting tied up before they’ve seen
anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>thoughtfully.</i>] I can never understand why a
man gets married. He’s got so many chances to see the world and do things—and then he goes
and marries and settles down and is a family man before he’s twenty-four.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> It’s a habit.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> If I were a man I wouldn’t stay in England another
week. I wouldn’t be a quill-driver all my life.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> gets up and walks
restlessly up and down the room.</p>

<p class="noindent">If I were a man—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Men can’t do everything.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I say, don’t you think it’s fine of Mr. Tennant to
throw up everything and take the risk?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I’d do the same if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>coming forward a little.</i>] Where’s Charley? Oh,
never mind, I daresay he’s got a lantern and is looking for worms or something. Are you
ready, Mr. Tennant?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I wonder what Lil would say if you did!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> stops dead and looks at
<span class="name">MAGGIE.</span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> If I <i>did?</i> What are you talking about?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Why shouldn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Why shouldn’t I? Aren’t there a thousand
reasons?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> There’s Lily, certainly—but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> She wouldn’t understand. She’d think I was deserting
her.</p>

<p class="italics direction">A pause.</p>

<p class="noindent">But that’s not all. I might manage her—I don’t know—but—you see, I’ve
got a berth I can stay in all my life&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">TENNANT</span> starts singing the first
verse of “Off to Philadelphia.”</p>

<p class="noindent">It’s like throwing up a dead cert. And then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It <i>would</i> be a splash.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Yes—and think of all your people? What’d they say?
They’d say I was running away from Lil—of course, it would seem like
it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="italics direction">Another pause.</p>

<p class="noindent">It’s impossible. I might never get anything to do—and then—</p>

<p class="italics direction">His voice is suddenly drowned as the front room party sing
the chorus “With my Knapsack,” etc. Knock at front door.</p>

<p class="noindent">I—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I believe I heard a knock.</p>

<p class="italics direction">She goes out in corridor as <span class="name">TENNANT</span>
commences the second verse.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> sits on the edge of the
table watching and listening. The door opens and <span class="name">MAGGIE</span> enters,
followed by <span class="name"><span class="name">FENWICK.</span></span> <span
class="name">FENWICK</span> is a man of middle age, short and slight, with a quiet, rather
crushed manner.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Mr. Fenwick didn’t want to come in when he heard all
the singing. He thought we had a party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p class="italics direction">She goes through curtains.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, it’s nothing—a sort of family sing-song.</p>

<p><span class="name"><span class="name">FENWICK.</span></span> Miss Massey would have me
come in—but really I’d rather come some other—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Stuff! Sit down. I’ll pull the curtains if it’s
anything special you’ve come about. I thought it was perhaps over those geranium cuttings.
Afterwards, if you feel like it, we’ll go and join them. [<i>Draws curtains and turns up
light.</i>] Freddy Tennant—you know him, don’t you—he’s going to seek his fortune in the
Colonies.</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> Is he?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Yes, and we’ll drink his health. What’s up?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> I didn’t see you at the train to-day.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> No, you were late. I came on with Malcolm.</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> The chief sent for me.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Wasn’t a rise, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> Do I look like it? It’s the other thing.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Docking?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> [<i>nodding first and then speaking slowly.</i>] He said
he’d sent for me as senior of my department. The company has had a bad year and they can’t
give the usual rises.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> None?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> None. Haven’t you had a letter?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> No. I say, have I got the sack?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> No, you haven’t. But they’re offering you the same
alternative they offered me—stay on at less—or go.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>walking up and down.</i>] What are you going to
do?</p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> What can I do? Stay, of course—what else is there?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Sit down under it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">FEN.</span> What else?</p>

<p class="italics direction">Postman’s knock.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> There’s the postman. Wait a bit.</p>

<p class="italics direction">He goes out R. and the voices in the other room can be
distinctly heard laughing, while someone is playing a waltz tune very brilliantly.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> comes back with a letter in
his hand, closes door and music dies down.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Here it is. [<i>He opens and reads it, then throws
it on the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> A bit of a blow, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I didn’t expect it. Did you?</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Not until last week when Morgan started making
enquiries as to salaries, et cetera. Then I guessed.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> We can’t do anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> But I say, you know, it’s all rot about a bad year.
Don’t expect we’ve been exactly piling it up, but it’s nothing to grumble about.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> That doesn’t affect us, anyway. We’ve got to do as
we’re told. I fancy old Morgan is hit, too. He was sugary, but of course he had to obey
the instructions of the directors and so on.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> It’s no good swearing at him.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> It’s no good swearing at anybody. What’s a Board?
Where is it?</p>

<p class="italics direction">The curtains part and <span class="name">LILY</span> appears
in the opening.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley—are you there? Are you never coming back? Oh,
Mr. Fenwick!</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">FENWICK</span> rises; shake hands.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Good evening. I’m afraid I’m an awful nuisance, but
I just called to see your husband about a little business.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’ll stay to supper, won’t you? You and<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-28">[Pg 28]</a></span> Charley can sit and
talk business the whole time. I’m afraid Charley doesn’t like music very much—do you,
dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>big laugh from behind curtains.</i>] You should
hear Mr. Leslie. He’s so funny, he’s been giving Mr. Tennant advice what to do when he’s a
lonely bachelor in Australia. He made us <i>roar</i> with laughter.</p>

<p class="italics direction">Goes back laughing.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Silly ass!</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> [<i>startled.</i>] What?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> That chap Leslie! It’d do him good to go to
Australia for a bit. He’d stick to his berth if they docked his screw to ten bob. He’s got
no pride in him.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Well, we—at least, I—can’t say much—I’m going to
stay on. You, too, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>with a sort of defiance.</i>] Why should I?
What’s to hinder me leaving? Why shouldn’t I go to Morgan and say, “Look here—just tell
those directors that I won’t stand it! I’m not going to be put up or down—take this or
that—at their will and pleasure.”</p>

<p class="italics direction">There is a burst of laughter from the inner room.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> That’s all very well—and if you’ve got something
else—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>fiercely.</i>] I haven’t—not an idea of one—but
why should that hinder? Look at Tennant, he’s chucked his job and no one wanted to take
off anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> [<i>quite undisturbed.</i>] Tennant? Oh, he’s going
to the Colonies? Very risky. I nearly went there myself once.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Why didn’t you quite?</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Various things. All my people were against it. Oh,
well, what was the good of going? It was only a passing fancy, I daresay. Once you<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-29">[Pg 29]</a></span> leave a place the
chances are you won’t get another. There are so many of us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Of course, it’s safe and it’s wise and it’s sensible
and all that—but it’s <i>damnable.</i></p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> It’s come suddenly to you—I’ve almost got used to
the idea. [<i>With a little laugh.</i>] You do, you know, after a little. You’re
young.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [<i>With sigh.</i>] Well, there it is. [<i>A pause.</i>] But
I’d looked for that rise. It’ll make a difference. [<i>Pulling himself together.</i>]
However, it can’t be helped. We’ve got something left and I’m safe, and that’s more than a
good many people can say. I’m sorry I came tonight, Wilson.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LESLIE’S</span> voice can be heard,
shouting out a comic song.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<i>Smiling.</i>] Life doesn’t seem to worry him.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Won’t you stay and have supper?</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> Thanks, no. I don’t feel exactly sociable.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>with a short laugh.</i>] Neither do I, old chap.
Fact is, I was feeling a bit off when you came.</p>

<p><span class="name">FENWICK.</span> You’re a little restless, but it’ll work off. Look
at me. I felt like that once.</p>

<p class="italics direction">They go out.</p>

<p class="italics direction">The curtains are pulled wide and <span

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> May we interrupt? [<i>Looking around.</i>] Empty was

<p class="italics direction">Re-enter <span class="name">CHARLEY.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Where’s the business?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Fenwick’s been, but he’s just gone.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Fenwick? Wasn’t cheerful company, was he?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>crossly.</i>] What’s the matter with him?</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> He never is, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> He isn’t exactly boisterous. He nearly emigrated
once, he tells me.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>coming forward.</i>] Why didn’t he quite?</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Not enough devil in him. Hundreds of ’em almost
go.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Did you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> [<i>with energy.</i>] I’m comfortable enough where I
am. I’ve been telling this chap here he’s a fool, but he won’t believe me. He says he’d
rather be a fool in the Colonies than a wise man here. Don’t know what he means quite, but
it sounds rather smart. [<i>Waving his pipe oracularly as he faces the three men.</i>]
I’ve known lots of chaps who’ve wanted to go. The guv’nor is unpleasant or there’s too
much overtime or they get jealous of their girl or something of that sort and off they
must go. I’ve known a few who went—and sorry they were, too. You can’t do anything out
there. Read the emigration books, read your papers. Failure all along the line. Market
overcrowded. Only capitalists need apply—the Colonies don’t want you—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Neither does England—</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Of course not but [<i>waving his arm
impressively</i>] but you’re here and got something. That’s the whole point. My advice
is—stick where you are. Tennant’s a stupid ass to give up a decent berth; he deserves to
fail. Of course, we should all like to see the world. <i>I</i> should—</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> It’s more than that.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Yes, yes, you don’t understand. It isn’t the idea of
travelling—it’s because you want to feel—oh! [<i>He stretches out his arms.</i>] I don’t
suppose you ever feel so—</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Can’t say I did.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Aren’t you ever sick of the thing, Leslie?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> And don’t you ever want to pitch all the ledgers
into the dustbin and burn the stools?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Never—though I’ve met many that have. I tell you,
it’s a good thing to have a safe berth nowadays. Many fellows would only be too glad to
pick up Tennant’s berth—or yours, Wilson. Think of the crowds that will answer the
advertisement at Molesey’s— Last week our firm wanted a man to do overtime work, and they
don’t pay too high a rate—I can tell you. They had five hundred and fifteen
applications—five hundred and fifteen! Think of that! And that’s what would happen to you
if you went, Wilson, and that’ll be the end of Tennant. Sorry to be unpleasant—but
truth—</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> But there’s room on the land—</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Land! What on earth can a bally clerk do with a
spade? He’d be trying to stick it behind his ear—</p>

<p class="italics direction">Shout of laughter from <span class="name">PERCY
MASSEY.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">He’s got no muscle—he’s got a back that would break if he stooped—he’d
always have a cold in his nose—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Shut it, Leslie. You can’t call Tennant exactly
anæmic. And look at this. [<i>He strips off his coat and turns back his shirt sleeves to
display his arms.</i>] How’s that?</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">TENNANT</span> looks on with interest.
<span class="name">LESLIE</span> comes near and pinches <span

you’re an authority on the land question ’cause you grow sweet peas?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>digging his hands into the pockets without

that if I had a chance I could farm land with anybody. <i>Do</i> you think I chose this
beastly business of quill-driving because it’s the best work I know. Do you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> I don’t suppose you chose it at all. Your father
chose it for you.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> [<i>to <span class="name">CHARLEY.</span></i>] Well, I
say, what’s the matter with it?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> You wait till you’re a few years older.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Wilson’s caught the land fever. Take up an

Tennant?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> It’s in my room. Shall we go up?</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Is there a fire?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Bring it down, there’s a good chap. I like to take

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">TENNANT</span> goes out R.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">LESLIE</span> rises; goes back to the

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> I say, Charley—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> I’ve got a rise.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Congratulations—wish I had.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Foster’s given me Beckett’s job.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> And Beckett?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Well, he’s got the sack, you know. It’s a bit rough on
him, but I couldn’t help it, could I?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I suppose you’re doing it cheaper?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> That’s about the line. I’m awfully sorry for Beckett.
He’s not young, and it’s awfully hard to get anything when you’re middle-aged.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> So I believe. Well, anyhow, you’re in luck—aren’t
you?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Yes, it’s sooner than I thought.</p>

<p class="italics direction">They sit in silence.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Eh? What d’ye mean?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> You—and—and Lily—you know.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, that’s it, is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> You didn’t begin with a house, of course.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> You know as well as I do that we had three rooms—and
jolly small ones.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Still you were comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> It was warm—winter and summer.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> It wasn’t very expensive?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> You have to choose your housekeeper carefully.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> If you’re going to chaff—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Don’t be an idiot. You’ve now got ninety, I suppose.
You can manage on that.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> You really think so?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I know from experience.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> You don’t ask who the lady is?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Sybil is a pretty little girl.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Well, I suppose you did guess a bit.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Not me! Maggie and Lil did it between them.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Did it?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Made the match—Maggie told me.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> [<i>indignantly.</i>] They did nothing of the kind. I
met Sybil here and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> ’Um—um!</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> We just came together—it was bound to be.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> I say, old man.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Well, aren’t they? I suppose you won’t listen to

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> What about?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> You’re too young to marry.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> I’m twenty-three. So were you when you married.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I was too young.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Do you mean.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>impatiently.</i>] Oh, don’t look so scandalised.
No, I’m not tired of Lily. It’s not that at all—but, are you satisfied to be a clerk all
your life?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> I say, Tennant’s upset you. Of course I’m satisfied to
be a clerk.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> But <i>are</i> you?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> [<i>impatiently.</i>] Don’t I say so?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Have you ever felt a desire to kick your hat into
the fire? Have you?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> No! Not yet!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Not yet. There you are—but you will. Don’t you ever
want to see anything more of the world—did you ever have that feeling?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> [<i>a little thoughtfully.</i>] Well, I did once. I
wanted to go out with Robinson. But the dad wouldn’t consent. It was a bit risky, you
know, and this job came along—and so I wouldn’t go.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Did Robinson come back?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> No, he’s got a decent little place out there.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> They don’t all fail, then?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> Of course not—but lots do. I might be one of
those.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Well, the thing is if you ever thought of doing
anything now’s your time. You can’t do it afterwards. Take my tip and don’t get engaged
yet. You’re too young to decide such an important question.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> No younger than you were—and I must
say.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Don’t be so touchy—can’t you see I’m talking to you
for your good?</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> I think you’re crazed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>sharply.</i>] Why am I crazed, as you call it?
Isn’t it because I know a little what your life is going to be? Haven’t I gone backwards
and forwards to the city every day of my life since I was sixteen and am I crazed because
I suggest it’s a bit monotonous? [<i>Going close to <span class="name">PERCY</span> and
putting his hand on his shoulder solemnly.</i>] I’m not saying she isn’t the right girl
for you—I’m only suggesting that perhaps she isn’t! She’s pretty and she’s
handy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> I say! I won’t have that.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Don’t. Pass it over. It’s just this—think—and don’t
marry the first pretty girl and live in three rooms because your brother-in-law did
it.</p>

<p><span class="name">PERCY.</span> She wasn’t—the first pretty
girl.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, don’t, for heaven’s sake. It isn’t losing the

stands still, looking round. He goes to the front parlour and hunts over the chairs and

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Four o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> No, dear—of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I wouldn’t walk the streets this afternoon for any

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I don’t suppose they find it cold.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Oh, I daresay they’re sitting in the Park.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I hope they won’t be late for tea. I shall want mine
soon.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ll put on the kettle now and when Lil and Charley
come, we will have tea and not wait for the others. We’ll have it cosily in here. [<i>She

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Mother, did you love father when you married him—very
much, I mean, very, very much!</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>much astonished.</i>] What a question! Of
course.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> More than any other man you’d ever seen?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Of course!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> More than everything and everybody?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> <i>Of course!</i></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Well, there’s something wrong with me, then—or else
with Walter. I don’t feel a bit like that. There’s no “of course” with me. I wouldn’t go
and sit in the Park with him this afternoon for anything.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I suppose you’ve quarrelled?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> No, we haven’t. I wish we had.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Maggie! Don’t talk like that.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> But I do. He wants me to marry him next month.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> And a very good thing too.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He says he’s found a house, and wants me to go and
look at it. <i>I</i> don’t want to see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> What’s come over you lately? You used to be
satisfied. Walter is very nice and attentive—in fact, quite devoted.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Yes, I know. Just like he was to his first wife, I
expect.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> You’ve such an absurd prejudice against widowers,
Maggie. You’re jealous.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m not. Not a bit. But I do wish he would do
something, and not worry about getting married.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> The poor man is doing something, I should think,
running after you every spare minute, and house hunting.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I would much rather he went to Australia—or
somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> That’s that absurd Tennant man again. You’re not in

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>promptly.</i>] Not a scrap! I find him rather
dull.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Then what is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I should like Walter to go out and seek his fortune

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley is coming on. He’s gone to the station with Mr.

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> No—Mr. Tennant goes to-morrow.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> stops to listen.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> They’ve reduced Charley’s salary.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>sitting up energetically.</i>] Reduced it? What
for?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I don’t know—I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, I’m so
miserable. [<i>She suddenly covers her face with her hands and sobs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>stooping over her.</i>] Lil, dear, you’re not
crying over <i>that,</i> are you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>sobbing.</i>] Oh, no, no! It doesn’t matter. We can
make room for two lodgers quite well. I don’t mind the work.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Then what is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I suppose you and Charley have quarrelled?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Tell us, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley—wants—to go away—and leave me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> What? What’s this?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>looking apprehensively round at the sleeping

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He won’t wake till the tea-cups rattle. Charley wants

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I <i>knew</i> they’d quarrelled.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> We haven’t—not exactly—but he’s been so<span

Mr. Tennant said he was going to Australia. He wants to go too.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> What next? Charley ought to be ashamed of himself. Go
to Australia indeed! He forgets he is married.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I don’t want him to stay just because he’s married, if
he wants to leave me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You are quite <i>wrong,</i> I’m sure, Lil. He doesn’t
want to leave you at all. He wants to leave his work.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Perhaps he does. So do other people very often.
Suppose we all stopped work when we didn’t like it? A pretty muddle the world would be in.
Charley is forgetting there is such a thing as duty.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> He’s very unhappy—and I—I can’t make him happy.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> So he ought to be miserable with such ideas in his
head. I never heard of such a thing! The sooner Mr. Tennant goes the better. He’s been
putting Charley up to this, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You don’t know Mr. Tennant, mother. He’s not that
sort.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Then what made Charley think of it at all?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It’s just a feeling you get sometimes, mother. You
can’t help it. Office work is awf’lly monotonous.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Of course it is. So is all work. Do you expect work
to be pleasant? Does anybody ever like work? The idea is absurd. Anyone would think work
was to be pleasant. You don’t come into the world to have pleasure. We’ve got to do our
duty, and the more cheerfully we can do it, the better for ourselves and everybody
else.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I—I didn’t mean to tell you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> He ought to be talked to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Don’t say anything, please—not yet. Perhaps after tea
we can all talk about it, and it may do him good.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> In here? There’s no room.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It’s cosey. I’ll bring yours to the sofa.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Where am I to put it?—on the floor?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ll bring up a table for you if you must have one.
You wouldn’t do for a Society gentleman. Can’t you balance a cup on your knee?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> I don’t mean to try. Hope you haven’t got out those

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Coming on.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Gone away for the week end?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>taking a cup for herself and sitting down beside

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> It’s all right about you, but Lil looks a bit off.
You’ve got a cold. Your eyes are red.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Yes, father.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> You’ve dropped some bread and butter on the carpet,
Alfred.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>irritably.</i>] Of course I have! I knew I

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>running to pick it up.</i>] Percy hasn’t come

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>his attention taken from his grievance.</i>]
What, in this weather?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> The seats will be dry and they sit close together,

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>chuckling.</i>] You have, have you? And what

but billing and cooing!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Especially Percy.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> P’raps so. He’s young at it. Well, he’ll be the next,
I suppose. And you, too, Mag?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m in no hurry.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>a little impatiently to <span

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Of course she says she isn’t. She’s a modest young

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Of course I shouldn’t—to you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Ha, ha! You put on the shy business then. Lord! these
women. [<i><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> moves towards table.</i>] Come, now, Mag,
confess! You think of it sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I think of it a lot.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> There you are! There you are! What did I say?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> And what do you think I think about it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> How should I know. Wedding, I suppose. I bet you
never think of anything else after the wedding day.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>slowly.</i>] I think of the wedding dress, and
the bridesmaids, and the pages. Shall I have pages, Mum?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Maggie!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I suppose I shan’t. I think of the house<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-49">[Pg 49]</a></span> I’m going to have,
Daddy—and the furniture, and I’m going to have a cat and a dog—</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>slyly.</i>] Nothing else, of course. Just a cat
and a dog. Ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Alfred, don’t suggest. It isn’t nice.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> A cat and dog—ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Don’t laugh, Daddy. I’m telling you the solemn
truth—I think most of all that I shall never, never, never have to go into a shop
again.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> I wish old Foster could hear you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> He’d say—“And where do I come in?”</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Well, of course he’ll be there. I wish—</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Maggie, my dear—I should like a little more tea! Have
you got some more hot water?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ll get some. [<i>Goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> It’s all very well for her to chaff, but she ain’t
quite natural about this affair of hers. She ought to be more pleased—excited like.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> I think they’ve had a little quarrel. People often
do. She’s a little bit down about it. We’ve had a talk about it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Well, she can’t have any quarrel about him himself.
<i>He’s</i> all right, and got a jolly soft job, too. He’ll make her a good husband. He’s
insured for £500.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> Is he? That’s very nice. If anything happened to him
she’d be all right.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> He’s a thoughtful sort of chap. Of course he’s not
exactly young, but he’s steady.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> The poor child is jealous of his first wife.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> You don’t say so? Jealous, is she? That’s all
right—that’s a healthy feeling. I’m glad she’s jealous, but she’ll get over it once she’s
married. Jealous! Lord! Fancy, Mag too—I wouldn’t have thought it. He’ll be head clerk,
one of these days—he can stay at Whitakers all his life. He told me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Do you think he’ll ever get tired of it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> What an idea!</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>roaring.</i>] Tired! Tired of what? A good job?
Why ever should he be? He couldn’t have anything better—Ten to half-past five every day of
his life, except Saturdays, and then it’s <i>one</i>—and three weeks’ holiday. Think of
that?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>impatiently drawing her hand away.</i>] It’s

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> All right, dear—I won’t bother you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Perhaps if you did bother—no, never mind. You know I
asked you not to come to-day.</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Well, I had no reason, except that I didn’t feel like
it. But I ought to feel like you always, didn’t I?</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> You’re different from me. I always feel like you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Walter, I don’t want to settle down. I want to go

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> What things, dear?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Oh, I don’t know. [<i>A pause.</i>] Did you ever go
abroad?</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> Yes, to Paris, once at Easter.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Oh! just for a holiday. Wouldn’t you just love to go
out and try your luck? Have a change?—Do something with your hands? Aren’t you ever tired
of what you are doing?</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> I can’t say I am, really. Why should I? The work is
not too hard. But you like change. I have a good salary, you know, dear. When we are
married you can go about a lot, you’ll be quite free.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> No, I shan’t.</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> But you can have a servant and all that, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Oh, yes—yes—I understand.</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> If I went abroad—suppose it, for instance—I shouldn’t
have you, should I?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> No, and a good thing for you. You deserve something
better. You know—you <i>know,</i> Walter, that I don’t love you half or a quarter as you
love me.</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> Yes, I know that. But you don’t love anybody
else.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> No. Have you ever thought that I’m really marrying
you to get out of the shop?</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> Of course not. Of course you are glad to leave the
shop because you don’t like it. You are so tied.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I should love to be absolutely independent,

so.</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> [<i>interrupting.</i>] Yes, and suppose you failed?
You should have thought of that before you married. You can’t run off when you like when

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>interrupting.</i>] Why not?—just hear him.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> It’s that I’m just sick of the office and the grind
every week and no change!—nothing new, nothing happening. Why, I haven’t seen anything of
the world. I just settled down to it—why?—just because other chaps do, because it’s the
right thing. I only live for Saturday—</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Do you suppose I like plumbing? Do you think I ever
did? No, but I stuck to it, and now look at me, got a nice little bit in the bank and
bought my own house. [<i>looks proudly round.</i>] Of course, I hated it, just as you
do.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Then why didn’t you try something else, Daddy?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> I like that! What could I do? I was taught plumbing.
We don’t have choice. Your grandfather put me to it, and of course I stuck to it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> But why didn’t you ask for a choice?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> Me! Why should I do such a thing? Father was a
plumber, and if it was good enough for him, it was good enough for me. Suppose I had
thrown it up and gone to Canada for a lark? A <i>nice</i> thing for my family. [<i>To
<span class="name">MAGGIE.</span></i>] You wouldn’t have had the education you’ve had, my

flighty notions. Live ’em down!</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> [<i>gently.</i>] We all have moments of discontent, I

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> A long time ago, but I’m quite safe now, dear.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> shrugs her shoulders and

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I never said you couldn’t live them down. I never

Lil?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>meekly.</i>] No, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> But you shouldn’t want to. It’s ridiculous.</p>

<p class="italics direction">A pause—nobody answers.</p>

<p class="noindent">But I’ll tell you what, marriage shouldn’t tie a man up as if he was a
slave. I don’t want to desert Lily—she’s my wife and I’m proud of it—but because I
married, am I never to strike out in anything? People like us are just cowards. We seize
on the first soft job—and there we stick, like whipped dogs. We’re afraid to ask for
anything, afraid to ask for a rise even—we wait till it comes. And when the boss says he
won’t give you one—do we up and say, “Then I’ll go somewhere where I can get more.” Not a
bit of it! What’s the good of sticking on here all our lives? Why shouldn’t somebody risk
something sometimes? We’re all so jolly frightened—we’ve got no spunk—that’s where the
others get the hold over us—we slog on day after day and when they cut our wages down we
take it as meek as Moses. We’re not men, we’re machines. Next week I’ve got my
choice—either to take less money to keep my job or to chuck it and try something else. You
say—everybody says—keep the job. I expect I shall—I’m a coward like all of you—but what I
want to know is, why can’t a man have a fit of restlessness and all that, without being
thought a villain?</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> But after all, we undertake responsibilities when we
marry, Mr. Wilson. We can’t overlook them.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I don’t want to. But I don’t think we ought to talk
as if when a man gets married he must always bring in just the same money.</p>

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> If you have the misfortune to have your salary
reduced, nobody would blame you.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I don’t know. I felt a bit of a beast when I had to
tell Lil about that.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>suddenly.</i>] If you went away, Lily could come

<p><span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>scandalised.</i>] How could she? Everybody would

<p><span class="name">FOSTER.</span> Live with <i>us,</i> dear?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>impatiently.</i>] No, here, I meant.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I’ve got a little cash put by that she could live
on. <i>Don’t</i> cry, Lil, for heaven’s sake! Can’t any of you see my point—or won’t
you?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> I suppose you’re a Socialist.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Doesn’t anybody but a Socialist ever have an
idea?</p>

<p><span class="name">MASSEY.</span> They’re mostly mad, if that’s what you mean. And
they’re always talking about the wickedness of the boss and the sweetness of the working

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I never said anything about either, and I’m not a
Socialist.</p>

<p class="scene"><i>SCENE:—Sitting-room at </i>55<i> Acacia Avenue. Early morning.</i></p>

<p class="italics scene"><span class="name">LILY</span> discovered, cutting sandwiches.
Ring at door. <span class="name">LILY</span> admits <span class="name">MAGGIE,</span> who
is dressed for the shop.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>rather nervously.</i>] You, Maggie! How early. What
is it?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ve come to help Mr. Tennant off, Lil. Where’s
Charley? Is he up?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, yes. [<i><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> goes to
the garden door and stands looking out.</i>] He’s been up a long while.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> So the great day has come. [<i>Turning.</i>] Is
Charley going, or isn’t he, Lil?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>nervously and avoiding <span
class="name">MAGGIE’S</span> eyes.</i>] No, of course not.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Because—why, how can he? [<i>Tearfully.</i>] Don’t
speak in that tone, Maggie.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> He would have decided to go, if you had encouraged
him.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I <i>did</i> encourage him. You heard me last night. I
told him—and I told him again after we got home—“If you want to go, I’ll never stand in
your way.”</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Yes, I heard. Is that how you told him last
night?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It doesn’t matter how I said it. He’ll get over it.
Everybody says he will—except you. And how could he go? It’s just an idea he’s got over
Mr. Tennant.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>angrily.</i>] Of course it’s Mr. Tennant.<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-66">[Pg 66]</a></span> Everybody speaks as if
Mr. Tennant was a wicked person going round tempting poor husbands to desert their wives.
“It’s all that Mr. Tennant.” “What a blessing when that man goes,” etc., etc., as if he
had a bad character. The truth is, that he’s done a jolly good thing. He’s stirred us all
up. He’s made us dissatisfied.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> What’s the good of that? Nobody can make things
different if they wanted to.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Don’t talk nonsense. Hasn’t he made things different
himself? [<i>Getting a little heroic.</i>] Heaps of fellows in London go on doing the same
old thing, in the same old way, only too glad if it’s safe. Look how everybody runs for
the Civil Service. Why? Because it’s safe, of course, and because they’ll get a pension.
Look at the post office clerks and Somerset House and lawyer’s clerks and bank clerks—</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Bank clerks don’t get pensions—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I know they don’t, but once in a bank, always in a
bank. Is there anything to look forward to—and aren’t they all just—exactly <i>alike?</i>
I once went past a lot of offices in the city—I don’t know what sort of offices they were.
But the windows had dingy drab blinds, and inside there were rows and <i>rows</i> of
clerks, sitting on high stools, bending over great books on desks. And over each there was
an electric light under a green shade. There they were scribbling away—and outside there
was a most beautiful sunset. I shall never, never, forget those men.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> They don’t have long hours.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> [<i>promptly.</i>] Nine to six.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I always thought it was ten to four.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Don’t you believe it. That’s what I thought once.
You’re thinking of the bank clerks, of course. My dear, the doors close at half-past three
or four—but the clerks—why, they never see the daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> In the summer they do.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>impressively.</i>] I don’t care what you say, or
what anybody says, it’s not right. And if the men have got used to it, it’s all the worse.
They want stirring up—and it’s the women who’ve got to do the stirring.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Whatever can <i>they</i> do?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Lots. It’s the women who make the men afraid. In the
old days the women used to help the men on with their armour and give them favours to
wear, and send them forth to fight. That’s the spirit we want now. Instead of that we say
to the men:—“I shouldn’t trouble, my dear, if I were you. You’re safe here. Do be
careful.”</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’re very unjust. Look at the Boer War, and how brave
the women were then.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> That isn’t the only kind of war. Is a soldier to be
the only kind of man, that a woman’s going to encourage? Can’t she help the man who wants
to make a better thing of life? Oh, what a lovely chance you had and didn’t take it,
Lil!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> How can you talk like that! What a fuss you’re making
over a little thing.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It wasn’t a little thing. Here is Charley, with all
sorts of “go” in him and fire and energy. Why couldn’t you go to him and say, “I’m proud
of you. Throw up the horrid business and go and seek your fortune.” It was all he wanted,
I do believe. Instead of which, he’s got every blessed person against him—wife,
mother-in-law, father-in-law, and all his friends and relations, and everything he can
have. Everybody thinks him mad.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> <i>You</i> ought to have married him, I should
think!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Don’t get spiteful, Lil!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Wait till you’re married yourself to Walter—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m not going to marry Walter.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>struck with astonishment.</i>] You’re not going to
marry Walter? Maggie!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’ve broken it off. I did it last night.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Whatever for? Did you quarrel? You were a little touchy
last night, I thought—but Walter is so good tempered.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m sure it’s very good of him, but I don’t wish to
be forgiven and taken back. It was all through Mr. Tennant.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>anxiously.</i>] You don’t love <i>him?</i></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>exasperated.</i>] No, I’m not in love with
<i>anybody;</i> but all last week I was thinking and thinking, and it wasn’t till last
night that I found I was just marrying—to get away from the shop!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But he was <i>devoted</i> to you and so kind.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I don’t want kindness. My shopwalker is very kind
where I am, and I don’t see any need to change.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> How extraordinary you talk!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Well, when I heard Charley talking last night, I
thought what a fool I was to throw up one sort of—cage—for another.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But you <i>are</i> free when you’re married—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Nobody is—more especially the woman. But the thing
is, I shouldn’t want to be, if I loved the man. But I don’t love Walter, only his house.
Now, I can leave the shop any day, when I’ve saved enough—and run away. But I couldn’t run
away from Walter.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>horrified.</i>] Run away—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>suddenly beginning to laugh.</i>] Can you see me?
Running away from Walter? <i>Walter!</i> Oh! [<i>She laughs, but <span
class="name">LILY</span> looks very grave.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You don’t take the matter seriously.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It shows how seriously I do take it. Have<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-69">[Pg 69]</a></span> you ever heard of any
girl, throwing up a good match, who wasn’t dead serious?</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">TENNANT</span> enters.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Good morning. Oh, good morning, Miss Massey.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’re ready for breakfast, aren’t you?</p>

<p class="direction italics">Goes out.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Aren’t you surprised to see me here? I wanted to give
you a send off.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Awfully good of you.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> You’re quite a hero in my eyes, you know, and I feel
I must cheer or do something extra. [<i><span class="name">LILY</span> comes in with
porridge.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’ll have some, won’t you, Maggie?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Thanks. Here, I’ll pour out the tea.</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">LILY</span> goes out.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<i>To <span class="name">TENNANT.</span></i>] Aren’t you just
frightfully excited?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Can’t say I am.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>sighing and looking admiringly at him.</i>] I
should be <i>wild,</i> absolutely wild, if I were going.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> I’m going to chance it, you know. There’s no fortune
waiting for me.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> That’s the point of it. You know it’s awfully
unsettling, all this talk about Australia. You’ve made me so dissatisfied. I don’t feel I
can go back to the shop.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>easily.</i>] You’ll get over that.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Oh, I suppose so.</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">LILY</span> enters with toast and puts it
down beside him.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>turning.</i>] Please don’t bring anything else,
Mrs. Wilson. I can’t eat it.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> But it’s such a journey to the boat.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Oh, that’s nothing—besides, I’ve got these
sandwiches. [<i>Laying his hand on the package near him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Are you sure there are enough? I can soon cut some
more.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Heaps, thanks. [<i>Earnestly.</i>] Really, I shan’t
know what to do with them.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I’ll put you an apple or two in.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> No, don’t—</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, but they won’t take up much room.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>resignedly.</i>] Thanks very much.</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> enters.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, there you are. You’ll have breakfast now, dear,
won’t you?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I’ll have it later. You here, Mag?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Of course. Do you think this great event could go off
without me?</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">LILY</span> and <span

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>smilingly.</i>] Miss Massey seems to think it’s
a sort of picnic.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>absently.</i>] Does she?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> She’d marry well out there, I daresay.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Would she?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> She looks strong and healthy. Her sort get snapped
up in no time.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> You’re catching the 10.15, aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>surprised.</i>] Yes. Why? Coming to the
station?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> There’s another just after twelve—</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">TENNANT,</span> who has been swinging his
chair backwards, comes to a pause as <span class="name">CHARLEY</span> comes up to
him.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> Is there? I don’t know. But what—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>lowering his voice.</i>] Look here, old chap,
suppose I come too?</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> What!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>who keeps his voice rather low the whole time,
though visibly excited.</i>] Don’t shout! I haven’t<span class="pagenum"><a

look out for me at Plymouth.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> But, Wilson—I say—you—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Don’t! It’s all settled. There’s no use arguing.
I’ve made up my mind. I’m going to leave here as usual and coming on by the second train
and pick you up at Plymouth. Don’t stare like that—I’ve thought it all out—</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> But your wife—your people here—you can’t do it. When
I’ve gone, you’ll get over it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Get over it? I’m not going to get over anything.
I’ve been a coward, see?—and now I’m going to cut and run. It’s no good telling
<i>Lil</i>—she wouldn’t understand—but when I’m out there and get something and making a
tidy little place for her, she’ll be all right. She’s nervous—the women are like that, you
know—they can’t help it—and her people, too—well, they’re old, and when you’re old, you’re
afraid.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> [<i>interrupting.</i>] You mean to go! to-day?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Why not? Why not? If I put it off, I’ll never go. It
wants a bit of doing, and if you don’t do these things at the time, well, you give in.
I’ve packed a bag with some things—I did it this morning.</p>

<p><span class="name">TENNANT.</span> That’s why you were up so early—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I have written a note to Lil.
[<i>Argumentatively.</i>] It’s the only thing to do—there’s no other way—I say, Freddy,
you’ll stand by me? It’s easy for chaps like you—</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Miss Maggie, I’ll tell you a great, an awful secret.
[<i>He goes to her and says in a loud whisper.</i>] I mean to miss it.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>curtly.</i>] I’m all right. You don’t expect me
to laugh all the time, do you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LESLIE.</span> Certainly not. I’m afraid you’re still pining for the
flesh pots—or is it cocoanuts—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> No, it’s gourds—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> It was all through Mr. Tennant—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Tennant? You’re—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>impatiently.</i>] Oh, dear, NO. I’m not pining
for him. But I found out, when there was all this talk about Mr. Tennant, that I was
marrying Walter, because I wanted to be safe and was afraid of risk. Then I made up my
mind I wouldn’t do that. I tell you because—if a girl can risk things—surely a man—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> There wasn’t any risk for you with Walter. I can’t
see it.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> A woman isn’t tested in the same way as a man. It’s
the only way I have—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Well, you know best, and if you don’t like him—but
everybody thought you did. I must say you’ve been rather hard on Foster. You led him on. I
should have thought it was rather a good thing for you. Still.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>sighing.</i>] So it’s no good, then, saying
anything?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>uneasily.</i>] No—er— [<i>Turning to her.</i>]
Mag! What would you really think of me if I did?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> What? [<i>Looks at him for a second.</i>]
Charley—will you—after all?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Supposing I don’t give in—supposing I did go—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Do you mean it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Are you sure about Lil—I’m ready to throw up
everything—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I would look after her—she would be all right in a
week—I would do anything—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> But if I go it must be at once—at once, you
understand.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Yes, yes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> And if Lil thinks me a brute beast for leaving her
like this—in this way—you’ll explain—you’ll stick up for me—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> This way? I don’t—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I’m going to-day, Mag. I’ve arranged everything. I
couldn’t stand it. I had to go. I’ve written to Lil. She’ll be all right for money—I’ve
thought of that and I shall soon send for her. I know I shall, and then she’ll be glad I
did it. I look a brute, but, Mag, it’s got to be. [<i>Postman’s knock on front door.</i>]
Hush! Here comes Lil—don’t breathe a word—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> To-day!</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">LILY</span> enters with letters.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Here’s the post. Two for you, dear. [<i>Gives letters
to <span class="name">CHARLEY,</span> who, however, doesn’t look at them, but goes up to
map.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>quickly.</i>] I’ll call back for you, to go to
the station.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> All right.</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> goes out hurriedly.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I’m sure you’re ready for breakfast now, dear—and you
won’t have very much time.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I’m not very hungry.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It was so nice of Mr. Leslie to come in like that,
wasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Yes. He means all right.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>as he eats.</i>] They’re very nice neighbours. I
think we’re very lucky to have them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Um. You were up very early. You’ll be tired
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> These things don’t often happen, do they, and I can
keep better hours in future. We generally go along so regularly, don’t we?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>suddenly turning from his breakfast.</i>]
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> I’ve been thinking, dear, that we shall feel a little
dull to-night without Mr. Tennant. Shall we go to the theatre?—something light—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh—no—I don’t think so—</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Shall we ask the Leslies for whist?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>rising.</i>] No—not them—it doesn’t matter,
Lil—unless you’d rather.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Oh, I shall be quite happy at home, by ourselves. I am
so glad you would prefer that, dear. [<i>She goes up to him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I haven’t been up to much in the company line
lately, have I?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You’ll be better now, dear. What time shall you be
home?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> OK—er—you know my usual—</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Yes, dear. Don’t be late. I’ve got something to tell
you—which will please you, I think.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Have you?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Would you like to hear it now?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Is it important?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> <i>Is</i> it important? You’ll have to be such a good
man soon, dear—you’ll have to set a good example.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>uneasily.</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Can’t you guess? How dull you are! Bend down and let me
tell you. [<i>She pulls down his face and whispers.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>pulling himself away.</i>] What! God! [<i>Taking
her by the arms.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>turning away a second, and then turning
back.</i>] Is that true?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Yes, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Lil—I.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You <i>are</i> pleased! But of course you are.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Of course, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Isn’t it lovely to think of! And can’t you imagine
mother as grandmamma! Won’t she be a fuss! Why, you’re quite overcome. There! Go away and
get ready. You didn’t open your letters. There’s the door. I suppose it’s Maggie back.</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">LILY</span> goes out, and re-enters a
moment after with <span class="name">MAGGIE.</span></p>

<p class="direction italics">They meet <span class="name">CHARLEY</span> going out, and
<span class="name">MAGGIE,</span> looking at him almost stops him.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> What have you been saying to Charley, Lil?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I thought he looked a
little—upset.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> He is rather. He’s quite overcome, in fact. But then he
would be, of course.</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">MAGGIE</span> closes door, still looking
at <span class="name">LILY.</span></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> What about?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> What could I tell him, that would make him more pleased
than anything else?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> I’m sure I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> What generally happens when people are married?</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> That! [<i>Pause.</i>] Lily!</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Charley is delighted.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> [<i>unconsciously speaking her thought.</i>] So
you’ve <i>got</i> him after all.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>indignant.</i>] Maggie!!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Why did you tell him <i>now?</i></p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">LILY</span> goes out, a little
indignant.</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> enters from kitchen,
dressed for the office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Charley!</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> What’s up? Don’t rot, Mag!</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> And now—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Oh, let’s drop it. I was a fool all along—a bit of a
beast, too—it’s done with.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> But—</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> What’s the good of talking? Don’t make me out more
of a brute than I am! No, the thing was meant to be! I was mad. After all, a man can’t do
just what he likes! It’s better as it is. If this hadn’t happened I should have done
it—and a pretty mess, I daresay, I’d have been in—and dragged her in, too—</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> If—</p>

<p class="direction italics"><span class="name">LILY</span> enters.</p>

<p class="noindent">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t think I can wait for you, after all,
Charley.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Don’t trouble.</p>

<p><span class="name">MAGGIE.</span> Good-bye.</p>

<p class="direction italics">She goes.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> You didn’t open your letters, dear.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> What are they?</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> [<i>tearing one open.</i>] About the new lodger—very
quick replies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>hastily.</i>] Oh, leave them over.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> Ready?</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> [<i>moving his neck uneasily in the high
collar.</i>] Yes—this beastly collar.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> It’s a pity they make you wear such things.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> I’ve got a short neck. I suppose you shouldn’t be a
clerk, if you’ve got a short neck. It doesn’t fit the collars.</p>

<p><span class="name">LILY.</span> What an idea!</p>

<p class="italics direction"><span class="name">CHARLEY</span> stands looking at the map a
moment. Suddenly he tears it down and throws it into the fire.</p>

<p><span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> Good-bye, Lil. [<i>He kisses her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

reaches the door.</p>

Note</a></h3>

<p>This transcription is based on scanned images posted by the Internet Archive from a
copy in the University of Toronto Libraries:</p>

<p class="center"><a href="http://archive.org/details/chainsplayinfour00bakeuoft">
archive.org/details/chainsplayinfour00bakeuoft</a></p>

<p>The following changes were noted:</p>

<ul>
<li>p. 2: <span class="name">LILY.</span> Who’s Poppy, dear.—Changed period to a question
mark.</li>

<li>p. 7: I’ve er—got some news for you.—Inserted dash after “I’ve”.</li>

<li>p. 12: You are quite free to do as you like, aren’t’ you, Mr. Tennant?—Deleted
apostrophe after “aren’t”.</li>

<li>p. 15: [<i>lifting the curtain and coming forward with Leslie.</i>]—Changed
“<i>Leslie</i>” to unitalicized all caps.</li>

<li>p. 31: <span class="name">CHARLEY.</span> (<i>digging his hands into the
pockets…</i>—Changed opening parenthesis to opening bracket for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 36: [<i>To Charley.</i>] You must have something hot…—Changed “<i>Charley</i>” to
unitalicized all caps.</li>

<li>p. 45: <i>She brings back with her a tray, with cloth, etc.. and prepares for tea on a
small table.</i>—Changed second period after “<i>etc</i>” to a comma.</li>

<li>p. 48: <span class="name">MRS. M.</span> [<i>a little impatiently to
Maggie.</i>]—Changed “<i>Maggie</i>” to unitalicized all caps.</li>

<li>p. 54: The work is not too hard, But you like change.—Changed comma after “hard” to a
period.</li>

<li><a id="tnote_page-63" class="no_dec" href="#tnote_page-63_ref">p. 63:</a> Added stage
direction: “<i><span class="name">LILY</span> and <span class="name">MRS. MASSEY</span> go
out.</i>”—A few lines after Lily says “I’m quite ready to go”, there is a stage direction
for Lily and Mrs. Massey to re-enter, but the source text has no direction indicating
their exit. A stage direction indicating their exit was added right after Lily’s
line.</li>

<li>p. 78: <i><span class="name">LIL</span> goes out, and re-enters a moment after with
<span class="name">MAGGIE.</span></i>—Changed “<span class="name">LIL</span>” to “<span
class="name">LILY</span>”.</li>

<li>p. 80: <i><span class="name">LILY</span> runs to the door.</i> Good-bye.—Placed line
of dialogue (“Good-bye.”) on a separate line from the preceding stage direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some inconsistencies in the source text have been noted but allowed to stand as-is. For
example, Lily’s husband’s name is spelled both “Charley” and “Charlie.” On p. 58, Mrs.
Massey says, “Sybil told me distinctly this afternoon that Charley wanted to go to
Australia.” She is clearly referring to Lily, but the line has been left as printed.</p>

<p>The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the printed text.
However, some concessions have been made. For example, all stage directions were indented
the same amount from the left margin and coded as hanging paragraphs.</p>
